30/10/19, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: since a lot of people  wanted more  dp problems ,i will suggest few more

0)https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/burst-balloons/ (very easy )
1)https://www.spoj.com/problems/FARIDA/ (very easy)
2)https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-10359 (very easy, tiling dp)
3)https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-10003 (very easy, also find the time complexity of your solution)
4)https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1744/ (easy , somewhat  similar to above one , but only bottom up solution passes and top-down gives TLE )

//lis(longest increasing subsequence) is an important sub topic and there are few variations to it
5)https://www.codechef.com/problems/PEC005 ( easy , longest increasing subsequence(lis)  expected time complexity = O(N*N))
6)https://www.spoj.com/problems/LPIS/ (similar to above , lis )

//for below two problems actual time complexity required is O(N*logN) and is not taught till now , but if u can come up with some O(N*N) logic then it's also fine.
7)https://vjudge.net/problem/LightOJ-1421 (easy-medium , variation of lis , actual time complexity required is O(N*logN) but O(N*N) is fine for you people)
8)https://www.spoj.com/problems/LIS2/ (medium , variation of lis ,actual time complexity required is O(N*logN) but O(N*N) is fine for you people)

9)https://www.spoj.com/problems/MIXTURES/en/ (easy-medium)
10)https://vjudge.net/problem/LightOJ-1326 (medium-hard , counting )
11)https://www.spoj.com/problems/SCUBADIV/en/ (medium , knapsack)
12) Given an array of N integers , Consider all the subsequences of this array and for each subsequence find the sum of elements chosen and  push this sum into a
new array and sort it in ascending order. (medium )
sub task1:
there's only one query in it and this query contains a number K , and u have to report the Kth element in this new list.(use 1-indexing)
sub task2:
There are Q queries (Q&lt;=1e5) and for each query  a single number K is given , and u have to report the Kth element in this new list.(use 1-indexing)

 sample test case :
 //for sub task1
 input:
 3//this is N
 1 2 1 //this is array
 4 //this is K

 output:
 2 // 4th element in this new array is 2

 explanation:

//for each subsequence find it's sum and push it into a new array so
 in this case the new array will be {1,1,2,2,3,3,4} and we are given K=4 so the fourth element is 2

 note: with this we have done enough variety of dp problems, we can discuss solutions of these problems in next two classes.

26/11/19, 11:19 am - Pooja: Oj1 also
26/11/19, 11:19 am - Pooja: That aakash code one
26/11/19, 11:19 am - mehul mathur: You didn't copy at all in oj2
26/11/19, 11:20 am - Pooja: Nope
26/11/19, 11:20 am - mehul mathur: MRT?
26/11/19, 11:20 am - Pooja: Did myself
26/11/19, 11:20 am - mehul mathur: but like it's aggressive cows from geeks for geeks
26/11/19, 11:20 am - Pooja: I didnt see geeksforgeeks
26/11/19, 11:20 am - Pooja: Idk bro
26/11/19, 11:21 am - mehul mathur: I'm not confessing
26/11/19, 11:22 am - mehul mathur: I don't remember properly which ones I copied tho
26/11/19, 11:22 am - mehul mathur: I didn't copy copy anything
26/11/19, 11:23 am - mehul mathur: Just  read from geeks if anything
26/11/19, 11:29 am - Pooja: Chill da i think
26/11/19, 11:29 am - Pooja: Should be ok
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Hello
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Howd you guys do that lcm max one
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Fadi and lcm
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: 1285c
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Editorial says at most 11 primes
15/07/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Yyyyyyyyy
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: Uhh
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: So
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: Just
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: Find divisors of x
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: And then
15/07/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: Go thru the pair of divisors
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: And if both of their LCM is x then update your min
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: So like 36
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: Divs are
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: So you check 1 and 36
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: LCM is 36
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: Update min as 36
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: Check 2 and 18
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: Reject
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: 3 and 12
15/07/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: Reject
15/07/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: 4 and 9
15/07/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: LCM is 36
15/07/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: Update min to 9
15/07/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: And you done
15/07/20, 6:21 am - +91 86059 36547 changed the group name from "MRT aka Painter partition" to "Mehul,mnsi,desur"
15/07/20, 6:30 am - Pooja: How do you check if their lcm is x
15/07/20, 6:30 am - Pooja: You have to go through their factors too right
15/07/20, 6:30 am - mehul mathur: Arey
15/07/20, 6:30 am - Pooja: Wont that be tle
15/07/20, 6:30 am - mehul mathur: LCM is product divided by gcd
15/07/20, 6:31 am - Pooja: Ohhh yaa
15/07/20, 6:31 am - Pooja: Haha
15/07/20, 6:31 am - mehul mathur: Haha
15/07/20, 6:31 am - Pooja: Kill me thanns
15/07/20, 6:31 am - mehul mathur: 🧜‍♀️
17/07/20, 11:52 am - Pooja: Howd you guys do c
17/07/20, 11:52 am - Pooja: I didnt get ahaha
17/07/20, 12:04 pm - mehul mathur: So uh
17/07/20, 12:04 pm - mehul mathur: Because you only delete prefix
17/07/20, 12:04 pm - mehul mathur: That means thay
17/07/20, 12:04 pm - mehul mathur: Starting from last element you can decide how much youll keep
17/07/20, 12:04 pm - mehul mathur: Basically you need an array like
17/07/20, 12:05 pm - mehul mathur: 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2..
17/07/20, 12:05 pm - mehul mathur: Like increasing then decreasing
17/07/20, 12:06 pm - mehul mathur: So from last you start checking for such an arrangement
17/07/20, 12:07 pm - Pooja: Oh ok
17/07/20, 12:07 pm - Pooja: Thanks
17/07/20, 12:40 pm - mehul mathur: If any of you get D or E plzz tell me my laptop is now completely gone
17/07/20, 12:40 pm - mehul mathur: Thanks
19/07/20, 4:46 am - mehul mathur: I might not be good at cp but I have a very good eye for which contests to ditch😂
19/07/20, 4:46 am - Manasvi💩: :(
19/07/20, 4:47 am - Pooja: i fked upppp
19/07/20, 4:47 am - Manasvi💩: did you submit anything?
19/07/20, 4:47 am - Manasvi💩: bro a wa 4 timesss
19/07/20, 4:47 am - mehul mathur: Does number of wa affect rating?
19/07/20, 4:48 am - Manasvi💩: maybe
19/07/20, 4:48 am - Manasvi💩: idk
19/07/20, 4:48 am - mehul mathur: Actually even if I would have given I would have to use my family laptop.and that's hella slow
19/07/20, 4:49 am - mehul mathur: I kept refreshing the standings I thought there's a glitch but nobody solved
19/07/20, 4:49 am - mehul mathur: So lite
19/07/20, 4:49 am - Pooja: itswa
19/07/20, 4:49 am - Pooja: My codes so ugly tho
19/07/20, 4:49 am - Pooja: Ya it does
19/07/20, 4:49 am - Pooja: It reduces points you get in the contest i think
19/07/20, 4:50 am - Manasvi💩: lol fuck
19/07/20, 4:50 am - Pooja: 2000 people did
19/07/20, 4:50 am - Pooja: Its been an hour almos
19/07/20, 4:51 am - mehul mathur: Ok manasvi stop then
19/07/20, 4:51 am - mehul mathur: We bought nutella
19/07/20, 4:51 am - mehul mathur: And now I feel sick
19/07/20, 4:51 am - mehul mathur: Cuz I have no self control
19/07/20, 6:00 am - mehul mathur: Manasvi is fucking crazy
19/07/20, 6:01 am - Pooja: She got?
19/07/20, 6:01 am - mehul mathur: A and B
19/07/20, 6:02 am - mehul mathur: Our first specialist
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Pooja: AAHAHHHHH
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Pooja: MYGIRRLLLLL
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Pooja: GGGGG
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Pooja: Mofo
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Pooja: Come be hype
19/07/20, 6:02 am - mehul mathur: I am I am
19/07/20, 6:02 am - Manasvi💩: yessss
19/07/20, 6:02 am - mehul mathur: I was watching the standings
19/07/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: Rating?
19/07/20, 6:03 am - Manasvi💩: +69
19/07/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: Wait actually wait for testing to finish
19/07/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: Then you'll see the actual
19/07/20, 6:03 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
19/07/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: You said 89 before
19/07/20, 6:03 am - Manasvi💩: yeah but half an hr pass na after that
19/07/20, 6:04 am - mehul mathur: Bro holy shit tho
19/07/20, 6:04 am - mehul mathur: How
19/07/20, 6:04 am - Pooja: Whooopwhooopp
19/07/20, 6:08 am - +91 86059 36547 changed the group name from "Mehul,mnsi,desur" to "Manasvi bhai god"
10/08/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: ok so
10/08/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: how does the groups thing work again
10/08/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: which group does what?
10/08/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: and we sure na ki we can make groups ourselves only
10/08/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: both of you read it reply
10/08/20, 2:27 am - Manasvi💩: Yeah yeag
10/08/20, 2:27 am - Manasvi💩: We'll be one group
10/08/20, 2:27 am - Manasvi💩: Ez
10/08/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: and also this means quiz also we do in group
10/08/20, 2:27 am - Manasvi💩: That's the group assessment
10/08/20, 2:28 am - Manasvi💩: Quiz is individual only
10/08/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: no no i meant
10/08/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: quiz
10/08/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: we help
10/08/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: each other
10/08/20, 2:28 am - Manasvi💩: Yeah lol
10/08/20, 2:52 am - mehul mathur: Bro manasvi
10/08/20, 2:52 am - mehul mathur: Pushing for expert
10/08/20, 5:42 am - Manasvi💩: dheere dheere
10/08/20, 11:26 pm - mehul mathur: Let's brainstorm
12/08/20, 11:53 pm - mehul mathur: arey bhaiyo
12/08/20, 11:54 pm - mehul mathur: how did he say set of all problems is same cardinality as p({0,1*)
13/08/20, 12:04 am - Pooja: whatever problem you take
13/08/20, 12:04 am - Pooja: You can represent it as some binary string of some length k
13/08/20, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: ya i understood
13/08/20, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: you mean subset of bit strings na?
13/08/20, 12:07 am - Pooja: i thought one string not a subset
13/08/20, 12:07 am - Pooja: But yeah that works ig
13/08/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: No because every problem
13/08/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: Is actually the subset of inputs which gives answer Yes
13/08/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: And inputs are binary strings
13/08/20, 12:08 am - mehul mathur: So every problem is a subset of binary strings
13/08/20, 12:08 am - mehul mathur: So set of all problems is a set of all such subsets
13/08/20, 12:17 am - Manasvi💩: i was thinking of a problem as a string
13/08/20, 12:17 am - Manasvi💩: and whether or not it can be solved using a certain program
13/08/20, 12:33 am - mehul mathur: How
13/08/20, 12:42 am - Manasvi💩: I'll represent a problem as a bit string
13/08/20, 12:42 am - Manasvi💩: And each bit is a program
13/08/20, 12:42 am - Manasvi💩: And whether or not the program can solve it
13/08/20, 12:42 am - Manasvi💩: S represented as 0 1
13/08/20, 12:42 am - Manasvi💩: Is*
13/08/20, 12:43 am - Manasvi💩: So technically a problem is subset of some programs
13/08/20, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: Wtf
13/08/20, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: So what does that prove?
13/08/20, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: This don't work
13/08/20, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: What is the problem 00000000.. then?
13/08/20, 1:01 am - Manasvi💩: cant be solved?
13/08/20, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: Also here you are first only assuming that each problem can be solved
13/08/20, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: arey you have to prove that
13/08/20, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: you cant say that 0000 means cant be solved
13/08/20, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: you have to prove that there always some problems that cnt be solved
13/08/20, 1:02 am - Manasvi💩: it just means with the program i have with me i cant solve it
13/08/20, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: program you have with you kya?
13/08/20, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: what programs you have bey
13/08/20, 1:02 am - Manasvi💩: stfu
13/08/20, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: abey chup
13/08/20, 1:02 am - Manasvi💩: fo
13/08/20, 1:02 am - Manasvi💩: youre making me mad
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Manasvi💩: idk maybe im seeing it worng
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Manasvi💩: wrong*
13/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: ya
13/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: just a little wrong
13/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: no i lied
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Pooja: youre right
13/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: me?
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Pooja: each problem is subset of power set
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Pooja: ya mehul
13/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: ha
13/08/20, 1:03 am - Manasvi💩: thats what i said na

15/08/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Did you write science notes
15/08/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: What was the function he gave just after talking about linearisation
15/08/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: He integrated it to get x*e^ct i think
15/08/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: But the differential equation i have for that makes no sense lol
15/08/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Send pic of that page please

15/08/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: Ok im fkn retarded
15/08/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: How does dx/dt = cx
15/08/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: When solved give x(t) = (x0)e^ct
15/08/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: ?
15/08/20, 8:49 am - Pooja: And for that last hw he gave
15/08/20, 8:49 am - Pooja: The behavior at second fp
15/08/20, 8:49 am - Pooja: Theres only one case and it oscillatingly converges right?
15/08/20, 8:52 am - mehul mathur: Wait you are talking about thr alpha one?
15/08/20, 8:56 am - Pooja: yeah
15/08/20, 8:57 am - Pooja: This before one
15/08/20, 9:01 am - mehul mathur: Ha toh usme there are cases like alpha from 0 to 1 then 1 to 2 2 to 3 like that
15/08/20, 9:05 am - Pooja: Dont those all end up with same behavior?
15/08/20, 9:14 am - mehul mathur: No no the differential changes
15/08/20, 9:14 am - mehul mathur: Becomes positive or negative
15/08/20, 11:51 am - Pooja: what
15/08/20, 11:51 am - Pooja: Also this plssss
15/08/20, 11:52 am - mehul mathur: Arey so
15/08/20, 11:52 am - mehul mathur: dx/dt = cx
15/08/20, 11:52 am - mehul mathur: Is rearranged as dx/cx = dt
15/08/20, 11:52 am - mehul mathur: Then integrate
15/08/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: 1/x integrated is logx
15/08/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: So it becomes logx/c = t + constant
15/08/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: logx = ct + c*constant
15/08/20, 11:53 am - Pooja: Woomygodddd
15/08/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: The do e raised to stuff

17/08/20, 5:53 am - mehul mathur: manasvi after explain thanks
17/08/20, 5:59 am - mehul mathur: wait if you have option to open() with readononly with O_RONLY wagaira O_WONLY wagaira then why you need third permission argument
17/08/20, 6:00 am - mehul mathur: thenku pooja
17/08/20, 6:01 am - mehul mathur: ohhhhhh got it
17/08/20, 6:01 am - mehul mathur: wait that O_ONLY means that to that fd you can only read or it means that only open a readonly file
17/08/20, 6:03 am - Pooja: The only stuff is for the fd
17/08/20, 6:03 am - Pooja: When youre creating you need the chmods
17/08/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: achha
17/08/20, 6:03 am - mehul mathur: ya that 110 01 01 shit
17/08/20, 6:05 am - Pooja: yeah
17/08/20, 6:05 am - mehul mathur: wait i dont understand your doubt
17/08/20, 6:07 am - Pooja: Like you create assignment
17/08/20, 6:07 am - Pooja: Then 1.txt in that
17/08/20, 6:07 am - Pooja: Second time you run it
17/08/20, 6:07 am - mehul mathur: in the first question ya
17/08/20, 6:07 am - Pooja: Should assignment dir have 1.txt and 2.txt
17/08/20, 6:07 am - Pooja: Or only 2.txt
17/08/20, 6:08 am - mehul mathur: 1.txt and 2.txt are straight and reverse na?
17/08/20, 6:08 am - Pooja: No both reverse
17/08/20, 6:08 am - Pooja: If you expect Q1.c twice i mean
17/08/20, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: oh ok ok
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Manasvi💩: youll have to delete the directory na
17/08/20, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: or overwrite file?
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Pooja: you can just say no need to create again right
17/08/20, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: ya ya
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Manasvi💩: i think we should  use perror then
17/08/20, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: did you start coding?
17/08/20, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: from the mkdir?
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Manasvi💩: like if its already there
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Pooja: whos ayushman oanda
17/08/20, 6:09 am - Pooja: Panda
17/08/20, 6:10 am - Pooja: Is he le
17/08/20, 6:10 am - mehul mathur: khurana hes my relative
17/08/20, 6:10 am - Manasvi💩: whatta lovely name
17/08/20, 6:11 am - mehul mathur: manasvi which perror
17/08/20, 6:11 am - Manasvi💩: nvm
17/08/20, 6:11 am - mehul mathur: arey
17/08/20, 6:11 am - mehul mathur: bol na
17/08/20, 6:11 am - Pooja: We shouldnt use perror no
17/08/20, 6:11 am - Pooja: Its not an error?
17/08/20, 6:12 am - mehul mathur: what
17/08/20, 6:12 am - mehul mathur: perror just says what the errno means na
17/08/20, 6:12 am - mehul mathur: so we have to use perror
17/08/20, 6:13 am - mehul mathur: like if errno is 2
17/08/20, 6:14 am - mehul mathur: perror("message") will be
17/08/20, 6:14 am - mehul mathur: message : file doesnt exist
17/08/20, 6:14 am - Pooja: i meant in that case i was talking about
17/08/20, 6:14 am - mehul mathur: no he said na
17/08/20, 6:14 am - mehul mathur: mkdir if already directory is there gives error
17/08/20, 6:14 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: so check if the dir exists
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: If it exists
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Dont use mkdir
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: ?
17/08/20, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: oho
17/08/20, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: okay
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Its little change in code anyway
17/08/20, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: u coded?
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: Hes saying you cant go byte by byte???
17/08/20, 6:15 am - Pooja: How
17/08/20, 6:16 am - mehul mathur: algorithm
17/08/20, 6:17 am - Manasvi💩: read line by line?
17/08/20, 6:17 am - Manasvi💩: i think tats a thing
17/08/20, 6:17 am - Manasvi💩: thats*
17/08/20, 6:17 am - mehul mathur: hm
17/08/20, 6:17 am - mehul mathur: read with what
17/08/20, 6:17 am - mehul mathur: open () na
17/08/20, 6:18 am - Manasvi💩: no thats only for opening files
17/08/20, 6:18 am - Manasvi💩: i think theres a read()
17/08/20, 6:18 am - Manasvi💩: not sure
17/08/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: hmhm
17/08/20, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: send code
17/08/20, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: bhai code nahi hai
17/08/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: kya behen
17/08/20, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: meko laga tum kassi ho
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: wait whatd he say for abc/n
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: it should give new line bca
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: or n/cba
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: ayo
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: fk lol
17/08/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: wait /n will come first now na
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: arey buttt
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: reversing stuff
17/08/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: right/
17/08/20, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: ?
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: takes o(n) time na
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: so wont it be
17/08/20, 6:21 am - Pooja: byte by byte
17/08/20, 6:22 am - mehul mathur: ya but o(n) is fine no
17/08/20, 6:22 am - Pooja: 1gb
17/08/20, 6:22 am - Manasvi💩: thatll take forever
17/08/20, 6:22 am - mehul mathur: arey how to reverse now in 0(logn)
17/08/20, 6:22 am - Pooja: there isnt an easier way to reverse tho na
17/08/20, 6:22 am - Pooja: i think its ok?
17/08/20, 6:22 am - Pooja: less than a min
17/08/20, 6:23 am - Pooja: lets see idfk
17/08/20, 6:23 am - mehul mathur: ya he said
17/08/20, 6:23 am - mehul mathur: just shouldnt take forever
17/08/20, 6:23 am - mehul mathur: 1 min everyone can wait
17/08/20, 6:23 am - mehul mathur: even big companies
17/08/20, 6:23 am - mehul mathur: ok ill start coding later
17/08/20, 6:24 am - mehul mathur: manasvi is till section 1.5 worth reading?
17/08/20, 6:25 am - Manasvi💩: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wzmEKjNqiU&t=2180s
17/08/20, 6:25 am - Manasvi💩: i found a video
17/08/20, 6:25 am - Manasvi💩: idk if its of use
17/08/20, 6:26 am - mehul mathur: uh wtf
17/08/20, 6:26 am - mehul mathur: i dont think this much will be there
17/08/20, 6:26 am - mehul mathur: he said main pages
17/08/20, 6:26 am - mehul mathur: its a 53 min video
17/08/20, 6:31 am - Manasvi💩: hmm
17/08/20, 6:49 am - Pooja: wait a sec
17/08/20, 6:49 am - Pooja: the input is a text file
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: /n should be read as \n
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: the fk is /n in a text file
17/08/20, 6:50 am - mehul mathur: ya toh?
17/08/20, 6:50 am - mehul mathur: in the file it wont be visible
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: not a new line
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: no it should be
17/08/20, 6:50 am - mehul mathur: but if someone pressed enter means /n is there
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: its a text file na
17/08/20, 6:50 am - Pooja: we re just reversing the text files
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: ha toh if text file is like
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: dsvdv
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: f
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: sa
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: vd
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: av
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: then these are newlines in between
17/08/20, 6:51 am - Pooja: how will you read than then
17/08/20, 6:51 am - Pooja: there wont be \n for you to read
17/08/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: i mean if we finish reading a line and theres stuff in lines below it
17/08/20, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: that means again /n
17/08/20, 6:52 am - Pooja: tfff howll you read that
17/08/20, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: if we were going byte by byte
17/08/20, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: then obv itll read it
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: like if file is
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: hello
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: world
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: so after o from hello
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: next byte where will it go
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: itll have to go down ig?
17/08/20, 6:53 am - mehul mathur: so that means/n
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Pooja: but we ll have to split the file into many
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Pooja: to read big parts
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Pooja: *files
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Manasvi💩: when you read into an array
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Manasvi💩: how does it handle new lines?
17/08/20, 6:54 am - Pooja: idk
17/08/20, 6:55 am - mehul mathur: first of all what command to readdd
17/08/20, 6:55 am - Manasvi💩: read
17/08/20, 6:55 am - mehul mathur: im thinking if we find a command to read in C its man pages will answer the questions
17/08/20, 6:55 am - mehul mathur: you sure?
17/08/20, 6:55 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
17/08/20, 6:56 am - Manasvi💩: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html
17/08/20, 6:56 am - Manasvi💩: this
17/08/20, 6:56 am - mehul mathur: ok cool
17/08/20, 6:56 am - mehul mathur: whats the difference between clustered systems and multiprocessor systems go
17/08/20, 10:03 pm - mehul mathur: Arey why is team name newt
17/08/20, 10:03 pm - mehul mathur: What it meam
17/08/20, 10:03 pm - mehul mathur: Mean
17/08/20, 10:07 pm - Manasvi💩: eyii pooja
17/08/20, 10:08 pm - Manasvi💩: ly
17/08/20, 10:14 pm - Pooja: We adopted mehul
17/08/20, 10:14 pm - Manasvi💩: srikari lite
17/08/20, 10:15 pm - Pooja: I forgotttlol
17/08/20, 10:41 pm - mehul mathur: Huh?
17/08/20, 11:26 pm - mehul mathur: what was that transition function
18/08/20, 12:42 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
18/08/20, 12:43 am - Manasvi💩: ew
18/08/20, 12:43 am - Manasvi💩: gorss
18/08/20, 12:43 am - Manasvi💩: gross*
18/08/20, 12:43 am - mehul mathur: wdym
18/08/20, 12:43 am - mehul mathur: its a fucking progress bar
18/08/20, 2:00 am - Pooja: What are the xn primes
18/08/20, 2:00 am - Pooja: I missed that
18/08/20, 2:01 am - Manasvi💩: values for critical alpha?
18/08/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: no those are some other xs thats it
18/08/20, 2:01 am - Manasvi💩: for which alpha?
18/08/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: chawla XDDD
18/08/20, 2:01 am - Manasvi💩: lmaoooo
18/08/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: arey alpha leave
18/08/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: x and x prime are just two diff xs
18/08/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: xn is nth iteration of x
18/08/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: xn prime is nth iteration of x prime
18/08/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Some random x?
18/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: ya
18/08/20, 2:04 am - Manasvi💩: what was he trying to do?
18/08/20, 2:04 am - mehul mathur: i dont know
18/08/20, 2:04 am - mehul mathur: hes saying xprime will go far awayy at n
18/08/20, 2:04 am - mehul mathur: but why?
18/08/20, 2:05 am - mehul mathur: but how was that related to newer fixed points and all
18/08/20, 2:06 am - Pooja: Hes trying to show the chaos part
18/08/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: ha but what happened to fixed poit
18/08/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: point
18/08/20, 2:06 am - Manasvi💩: gone
18/08/20, 2:06 am - Pooja: No itll go verryy close
18/08/20, 2:06 am - Manasvi💩: infinite fixed points
18/08/20, 2:06 am - Manasvi💩: thats why he said infinite cycle
18/08/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: ha toh then what?
18/08/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: everything will be a cycle
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: ha toh how is infinite cycle related to this and x and xprime going far away
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: far na
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: oh sorry
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: close close
18/08/20, 2:07 am - Pooja: Did he say the harjinder lecture
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: epsilon << delta
18/08/20, 2:07 am - Pooja: Is today or tomorrow
18/08/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: tomm
18/08/20, 2:07 am - Pooja: Peave
18/08/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: So today only tut right
18/08/20, 2:08 am - mehul mathur: wait so why will x and xprime go very close?
18/08/20, 2:08 am - mehul mathur: prob yeah
18/08/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: Askkk
18/08/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: Askask
18/08/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: Before he goes off
18/08/20, 2:08 am - mehul mathur: yeah im asking inly
18/08/20, 2:08 am - mehul mathur: oh him
18/08/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: obviously
18/08/20, 2:09 am - Pooja: They converge i guess
18/08/20, 2:09 am - Pooja: Not sure
18/08/20, 2:09 am - mehul mathur: converge?
18/08/20, 2:09 am - mehul mathur: as in
18/08/20, 2:09 am - Pooja: Bhai
18/08/20, 2:09 am - Pooja: Mic mei
18/08/20, 2:10 am - mehul mathur: ok
18/08/20, 2:10 am - mehul mathur: can you hear me
18/08/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: It happened for alpha greater than alpha c also na
18/08/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: Lmao
18/08/20, 2:12 am - mehul mathur: ha thats what
18/08/20, 2:12 am - mehul mathur: it happened more that too
18/08/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: what
18/08/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: i still didnt get why it goes closer when below alpha c
18/08/20, 2:15 am - Pooja: because its going to fixed point
18/08/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: When slope is greater than 1 for an alpha
18/08/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: Itll go towards the fixed point
18/08/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: Converves basically
18/08/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: Plot that shit ig
18/08/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: lesser than na
18/08/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: also how do you know the slope
18/08/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: Greater
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: if the graph goes above y=x line
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: It means slope is greater than 1
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Its all in tb
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Its damn good
18/08/20, 2:17 am - mehul mathur: kaunsi tb bhai
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: He put on moodle na
18/08/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Harshita asked some doubt
18/08/20, 2:17 am - mehul mathur: concepts modern physics one?
18/08/20, 2:18 am - Pooja: No
18/08/20, 2:18 am - Pooja: Some dynamical systems one
18/08/20, 2:18 am - Pooja: Chaos and dynamical systems i think
18/08/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: oh ok
18/08/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: introduction to chaos systems wala
18/08/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: i think ya
18/08/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: wait bro but whenever slope > 1 it goes away from fixed point
18/08/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: oh yaa
18/08/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ha so
18/08/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: when alpha is less
18/08/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: than alpha c
18/08/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: So ig up until thati ac it converges
18/08/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: you are saying x and xprime both go towards a fized point?
18/08/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: yeah
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: but as x value increases
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: It moves faster
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Is what i understood
18/08/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: from?
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: What
18/08/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: but what happens after alphac
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: yeah so he said na
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: That chaos stuff
18/08/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Im not too sure i havent read
18/08/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: only thing that changes is that now fixed points become infinite
18/08/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: so everything is a cycle
18/08/20, 2:24 am - Pooja: After he said the epsilon thing gets way bigger
18/08/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: so itll keep oscillationg
18/08/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: oh so wait
18/08/20, 2:24 am - Pooja: if its infitie cycle

26/08/20, 10:54 am - mehul mathur: my ta was nice
26/08/20, 10:55 am - mehul mathur: did you guys use string.h functions?
26/08/20, 10:55 am - mehul mathur: like in your reversing function
26/08/20, 10:55 am - mehul mathur: to get length of file
26/08/20, 10:55 am - mehul mathur: cuz first he checked with his own script some \0 was messing it up
26/08/20, 10:55 am - mehul mathur: when he checked with editor it worked
26/08/20, 10:56 am - mehul mathur: apparently we didnt have to use strlen
26/08/20, 10:56 am - mehul mathur: even tho they said you could
26/08/20, 10:56 am - mehul mathur: rest all was perfect
26/08/20, 10:56 am - mehul mathur: maybe he wont cut for that \0 mistake
26/08/20, 10:58 am - Manasvi💩: liiite
26/08/20, 10:58 am - Manasvi💩: it worked for big

26/08/20, 11:00 am - mehul mathur: So you tested it?
26/08/20, 11:00 am - mehul mathur: Bro did you handle missing arguments
26/08/20, 11:00 am - mehul mathur: ?
26/08/20, 11:00 am - mehul mathur: And also if there is a /0 in between?
26/08/20, 11:01 am - Manasvi💩: i handles for question 1

26/08/20, 11:02 am - Manasvi💩: what about it
26/08/20, 11:02 am - mehul mathur: There's a null character at the end by default na
26/08/20, 11:02 am - mehul mathur: So if they add it in between manually
26/08/20, 11:02 am - Manasvi💩: yeah that didnt give me any issues tho
26/08/20, 11:02 am - mehul mathur: It could mess it up

26/08/20, 11:02 am - Manasvi💩: nooo
26/08/20, 11:02 am - mehul mathur: Haa

26/08/20, 11:03 am - mehul mathur: Chill then you should be good then
26/08/20, 11:04 am - mehul mathur: Wait you used sizeof by default or you corrected from strlen?

28/08/20, 11:46 pm - Pooja: Recurrence
28/08/20, 11:47 pm - mehul mathur: oh waitt
28/08/20, 11:47 pm - mehul mathur: in one of the tutorial guys did
28/08/20, 11:48 pm - mehul mathur: in extra videos

29/08/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: watch from 50:00
29/08/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: he used induction
29/08/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: if you dont understand tell
29/08/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: ya he got c >= 10a
29/08/20, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: hes frozen na
29/08/20, 1:07 am - Pooja: no
29/08/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: wait is time slower for moving observer if clock is at rest
29/08/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: like what does time slower mean
29/08/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: difference between blips?
29/08/20, 1:36 am - Pooja: takes longer for stuff to happen
29/08/20, 1:36 am - Pooja: ya
29/08/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: what aakash said is wrong right?
29/08/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: just bc its moving doesnt mean ruler will contract
29/08/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: we only perceive stuff at rest when we move to contract
29/08/20, 1:38 am - mehul mathur: nothing is techincally the length
29/08/20, 1:38 am - mehul mathur: like
29/08/20, 1:38 am - mehul mathur: for every frame length is different
29/08/20, 1:39 am - Pooja: no
29/08/20, 1:39 am - Pooja: what
29/08/20, 1:39 am - Pooja: whole point is we re taking some constant somewhere

29/08/20, 1:54 am - mehul mathur: wait pook
29/08/20, 1:54 am - mehul mathur: the time axis is ct
29/08/20, 1:54 am - mehul mathur: so if a blip is after tau seconds what will be coords
29/08/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: not time
29/08/20, 1:55 am - Pooja: ct is dist
29/08/20, 1:55 am - mehul mathur: 0,c*tau or 0, tai
29/08/20, 1:55 am - mehul mathur: tau
29/08/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: ct is time axis bro

29/08/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: means what
29/08/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: x axis is distance
29/08/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: means dist only na
29/08/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: ct axis is time
29/08/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: x is dist travelled by thing
29/08/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: arey whatt
29/08/20, 1:58 am - Pooja: oh shitt wait that makes sense xD

29/08/20, 2:00 am - mehul mathur: ik but the ct time scaling
29/08/20, 2:00 am - mehul mathur: that shit is confusing

29/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: in the moving observer and clock at rest
29/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: difference between blips for moving observer was
29/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: gamma*tau ?
29/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: or gamma * c * tau?
29/08/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: or tau / gamma?

01/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: wait last one me
01/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: you applied length contraction na
01/09/20, 1:18 am - Pooja: yeah
01/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: but why dont you do x' = gamma * (x - vt) stuff?
01/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Thats not length contraction
01/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Displacememt is 0 na
01/09/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: displacement of?
01/09/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: i mean length contraction came from this na
01/09/20, 2:13 am - mehul mathur: displacement of???
01/09/20, 2:15 am - Pooja: like when he went and came back
01/09/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: oh arey leave that
01/09/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: like what if he just went one way
01/09/20, 2:15 am - Pooja: so question was
01/09/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: answer would be 6 * 0.8 na
01/09/20, 2:15 am - Pooja: Some measurement thing is on board
01/09/20, 2:15 am - mehul mathur: ya
01/09/20, 2:15 am - Pooja: This message was deleted
01/09/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: Difference between that measurement and normal
01/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: from the device not the earth
01/09/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: yeah sry
01/09/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: This right?
01/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: What is difference between the start and the end reading
01/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: this
01/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: not normal and that
01/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: idk what start and end means
01/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: I assumed that whats diff between what the instrument measured
01/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: On f' and f
01/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Basically
01/09/20, 2:17 am - mehul mathur: start reading of odometer and end reading
01/09/20, 2:17 am - mehul mathur: basically what the odometer on the rocket will say
01/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: what does that mean xD
01/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: Start reading is 0
01/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: Wait is f' is what?
01/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: End is whatever it measured right
01/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: Rocket
01/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: Ha and in length contraction it said for whichever frame rod is moving the length contracts right
01/09/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: So if we consider this distance he traveled as a huge rod and rocket as the frame then?
01/09/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: Then it makes sense right
01/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: woah what thats not what i was thinking
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: This guy is going super fast
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: So for him
01/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: wait you are saying 9.6 is the difference between what and what?
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: 1m will not be 1m measured by instrument right
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Think like that?
01/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: ya ya correct
01/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: thats what
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: yeah so thats what
01/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: so what is the instrument here
01/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: the odometer?
01/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Yeah
01/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Thats what seems like question is asking length contraction
01/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ya ok
01/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: but is that like saying
01/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: that every odometer on a car
01/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: is technically a bit wrong?
01/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: thats trippy right
01/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: The new length
01/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: We dont go anywhere near speed of light
01/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: So its negligent
01/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: ya ofc
01/09/20, 2:24 am - Pooja: What is this start end wording tho
01/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: its obv na start reading of odometer and end reading
01/09/20, 2:25 am - Pooja: Why not just say whatd it measure
01/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: what number it showed when you started the rocket and what number it showed when you came back
01/09/20, 2:25 am - Pooja: Who tf says
01/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: to be extra
01/09/20, 2:25 am - Pooja: Difference between a number and 0
01/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: what is the start and end reading of your scaleXD
01/09/20, 2:25 am - Pooja: Rather than just saying the number
01/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: XD
01/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: well we dont know if odometer was zero at start
01/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: rocket could be travelling before that
01/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: on earth
01/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: It couldve been traveling
01/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Rocket
01/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: You deleted this message
01/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Okay
01/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: abey couldve made trips before also

02/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: You deleted this message
02/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: You deleted this message
02/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: You deleted this message
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: theres a date brancing out from date
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: branching
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - Pooja: Yeah
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - Pooja: Thats what their doc says lol
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: ha toh thats wrong na
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: lets mention tha
02/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: that
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Manasvi💩: they put it as date month and year
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Pooja: Write odf
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Pooja: Off
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Manasvi💩: for date
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Manasvi💩: multivalued attribute
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - Manasvi💩: composite*
02/09/20, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: yeah ok thats too small a mistake leave it
02/09/20, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: pooja
02/09/20, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: player speciality is not the subclass
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: topspinner
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: backspinner
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: sidespinner
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: null
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: these are
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: player speciality is the attribute that differentioates them
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - mehul mathur: we can write that they didnt mention that its an overlapping subclass(a player can be topspinner and backspinner)
02/09/20, 1:04 pm - Pooja: they wrote subclass
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: So i put it as a subclass
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: it kinda is
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - mehul mathur: ya ya thats wrong how they wrote
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: Are you this spinner or this spinner
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: No its right
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - mehul mathur: arey but the spinner is the actual subclass
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: like we had are you maid or tour guide
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - mehul mathur: player speciality is how they are categorised
02/09/20, 1:05 pm - Pooja: they just called spinner speciality
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - Pooja: Thats what a subclass is
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: abeyy
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: maid
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: tour guide
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: these are subclasses
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - Pooja: Why
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: so we wont say that what they do is the subclass
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: thats the attribute
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - Pooja: Bc they differ in means of employment
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: so similarly
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: spinner
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: non spinner
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: these are subclasses
02/09/20, 1:06 pm - mehul mathur: not player speciality
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - mehul mathur: what im saying is it shouldnt be that player speciality in a rectangle
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: ahhh
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: Ok yeah
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: Ok change it
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: You have link na?
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - mehul mathur: sidespinner backspinner should be in rectangle
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: I closed laptop
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: Understood understood
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - mehul mathur: did you actually get it
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - mehul mathur: ok
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: Or delete it from the diag
02/09/20, 1:07 pm - Pooja: i wouldnt agree with you chumma dw😂😂
02/09/20, 1:08 pm - Pooja: And add analysis
02/09/20, 1:08 pm - Pooja: That they fked up that
02/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: pooja
02/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: check it now
02/09/20, 11:22 pm - mehul mathur: Ey what did he say after that ao is also disjoint with set
02/09/20, 11:29 pm - Pooja: 🤷‍♀️
02/09/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: Pooja submit
02/09/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: Group assignment

02/09/20, 11:57 pm - mehul mathur: what about it
02/09/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: we have to save in a text file?
02/09/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: The previous commands
02/09/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: Bc when you exit and run again
02/09/20, 11:57 pm - mehul mathur: i think yeah cuz bash does that
02/09/20, 11:57 pm - mehul mathur: i havent started it
02/09/20, 11:58 pm - mehul mathur: did you do nightswatch ?
02/09/20, 11:59 pm - Pooja: no
03/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: achha in history
03/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: if we save in text file
03/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: so how do we tell it that save only till 20 and retrieve only 10
03/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: and also maintain order of those 10
03/09/20, 12:01 am - Pooja: save with a loop ig
03/09/20, 12:01 am - Pooja: if more than 20 delete in textfile from start
03/09/20, 12:01 am - Pooja: And add to end
03/09/20, 12:01 am - Pooja: idk I havent implemented it i just read
03/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: where where tell
03/09/20, 12:02 am - Pooja: read the ass pdf lmao

03/09/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: why c?
03/09/20, 1:36 am - Pooja: Cant be 1.4
03/09/20, 1:37 am - mehul mathur: arey why c
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: One is .9 wrt other
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: A
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: B is .5 wrt a
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: So b wrt earth
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: Is 1.4
03/09/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: A is .9 wrt earth
03/09/20, 1:37 am - mehul mathur: oh you mean 1.4c is correct
03/09/20, 1:38 am - Pooja: but how can anything go faster than c right
03/09/20, 1:38 am - Pooja: Light is supposed to be fastest
03/09/20, 1:38 am - mehul mathur: oh right
03/09/20, 1:38 am - Pooja: Idk actually what the right ans is
03/09/20, 1:39 am - Pooja: whatd you out
03/09/20, 1:39 am - Pooja: Put
03/09/20, 1:40 am - mehul mathur: 0.72 dhruv told with velocity addition
03/09/20, 1:40 am - mehul mathur: but
03/09/20, 1:40 am - mehul mathur: that was wrong
03/09/20, 1:40 am - mehul mathur: it was 0.93
03/09/20, 1:40 am - Pooja: Lmao
03/09/20, 1:40 am - Pooja: 0 idea
03/09/20, 1:40 am - Pooja: Yeah i saw thst group

03/09/20, 1:41 am - mehul mathur: what happened then
03/09/20, 1:47 am - Pooja: Whats that p prime thingy
03/09/20, 1:48 am - mehul mathur: idk
03/09/20, 1:48 am - mehul mathur: anti proton
03/09/20, 1:48 am - mehul mathur: what is the question he is asking
03/09/20, 1:49 am - Pooja: what is minimum velocity required for this reaction to happen
03/09/20, 1:50 am - mehul mathur: what reaction
03/09/20, 1:50 am - mehul mathur: photons + photons/
03/09/20, 1:50 am - mehul mathur: ?
03/09/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: No photonsss
03/09/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: Theyre all protons
03/09/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: Hes saying this is reaction
03/09/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: It happened deal with it
03/09/20, 1:54 am - mehul mathur: then why is he saying c^2 and all
03/09/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: Now calc v required
03/09/20, 1:55 am - Pooja: For gamma
03/09/20, 1:55 am - Pooja: There c^2 is there na
03/09/20, 1:55 am - Pooja: one proton at rest
03/09/20, 1:55 am - Pooja: Other moving with v'
03/09/20, 1:55 am - mehul mathur: ok
03/09/20, 1:55 am - mehul mathur: and what is energy before?
03/09/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: 2 protons * mc^2
03/09/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: *gamma
03/09/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: ya whyy that
03/09/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: oh ok wait
03/09/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: thats total energy
03/09/20, 1:56 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 1:56 am - mehul mathur: and what is after?
03/09/20, 1:57 am - Pooja: Yeah arent we taking total energy only
03/09/20, 1:57 am - Pooja: including rest and ke everything
03/09/20, 1:57 am - Pooja: Rest and ke is total right
03/09/20, 1:57 am - mehul mathur: ok but he said that energy after is 4mc^2
03/09/20, 1:58 am - Pooja: Those are all only at rest
03/09/20, 1:58 am - Pooja: So we take ke to be 0
03/09/20, 1:58 am - Pooja: What do we write for notes today??
03/09/20, 1:59 am - mehul mathur: oh he said they all stop
03/09/20, 1:59 am - mehul mathur: achha toh he got gamma 2 from that
03/09/20, 1:59 am - mehul mathur: and then got v prime as sqrt(3) / 2 * c
03/09/20, 1:59 am - mehul mathur: then what is v
03/09/20, 2:00 am - Pooja: v' we want
03/09/20, 2:00 am - Pooja: actually idk
03/09/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: so v' is the velocity proton was moving to collide?
03/09/20, 2:01 am - Pooja: wait
03/09/20, 2:01 am - Pooja: So v'
03/09/20, 2:01 am - Pooja: What is root 3 by 2
03/09/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: the answer we got
03/09/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: by getting gamma = 2
03/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: i think we use this to find v now
03/09/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: ha?
03/09/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: how are frames involved now
03/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: werent they always
03/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: ya ok but
03/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: what is ux and v here
03/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: 0 and v?
03/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: One is at rest?
03/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Isk what im saying now
03/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Nvm
03/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: yeah my mind is blowing up

03/09/20, 2:08 am - Pooja: people dont know how to round uh
03/09/20, 2:10 am - mehul mathur: loll
03/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: ok @919980677602
03/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: explain here
03/09/20, 2:16 am - Pooja: wait
03/09/20, 2:16 am - mehul mathur: or wait ill tell
03/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Whyd he say that in f'
03/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: Both on lhs have same velocity
03/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: But opposite
03/09/20, 2:17 am - Pooja: My screen sharing is gone :(
03/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: ya
03/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: ya
03/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: but idk how or why well do that in rocket problem
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: No but how did we say that???
03/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: arey we said that a frame like that exists
03/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: it has to exist right
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: isnt it zero
03/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: what is?
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: Total momentum
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: bc same mass
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: Velocity opposite
03/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: Theyll cancel each other
03/09/20, 2:19 am - mehul mathur: ya but energy?
03/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: isnt energy in termsss of momentumm
03/09/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: arey noo
03/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: ok i think its in tb
03/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: He said he was referring to something
03/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: Ill read that im still confused
03/09/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: so youre saying if two particles are moving towards each other energy is 0/
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: truetrue
03/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: ch 1?
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Why do we say opp then
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Why not same dir
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: ?
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Idk i havent opened the book
03/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: i mean thats what his question was
03/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: like from a frame where this opposite shit happens back calculate v
03/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: Question was originally one is at rest and one is moving
03/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: how will they collide
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: lmaoo ya true
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ya but the problem with that was that the products also moved
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: ok so
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: so he chose a frame where products are at rest
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Once we get this v"
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: How to get v?
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ya ok ill tell
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Energy on lhs
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Okok
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Makes sense
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Got it got it
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: no no not energy
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ?
03/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: yeah no
03/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: if we know v prime in f prime
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Whether on f' or f
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Energy on both should be same?
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: For lhs
03/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: then to get in f we use velocity addition na
03/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: why is that relevant?
03/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: ek min we arent doing energy accross both frames
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: y not
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: energy no matter frame
03/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Will be same
03/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: energy on lhs and energy on rhs is energy before reaction and energy after
03/09/20, 2:24 am - Pooja: not that
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: ya but whats the use in calculating v
03/09/20, 2:24 am - Pooja: In gamma you can plug maybe?
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: arey velocity addition na
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: you know v prime in f prime right
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: and you wanna know
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: v in f
03/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: oh wait but
03/09/20, 2:25 am - Pooja: Why us what im saying wrong
03/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: do you know relative between frames?
03/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: achha toh wait lets do this one na
03/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: how will you back calculate v
03/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: now that you have v prime = sqrt(3) / 2 * c
03/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: its right
03/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: poojaaaa helloo
03/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: where you gooo
03/09/20, 2:30 am - mehul mathur: bro is it c / sqrt(2) ?
03/09/20, 2:30 am - Pooja: im confused
03/09/20, 2:30 am - mehul mathur: using energy conv
03/09/20, 2:30 am - Pooja: He said its .95c
03/09/20, 2:30 am - mehul mathur: you right then pooja
03/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: Final answer
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: no its 0.97
03/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: That was quiz question dei
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: wait pooja can you call for a min
03/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: Im confused bro
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: this proton thingu
03/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: Let me read and then let's discuss
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: arey
03/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: Idk what im saying only
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: proton question i wanna confirm
03/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: you are righttt
03/09/20, 2:32 am - mehul mathur: about energy being same
03/09/20, 2:32 am - mehul mathur: across frames
03/09/20, 2:32 am - Pooja: yeah
03/09/20, 2:32 am - mehul mathur: thats what i used and got v as c / sqrt(2)
03/09/20, 2:32 am - mehul mathur: i wanna discuss that
03/09/20, 2:34 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: ya ?
03/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: so its correct na
03/09/20, 2:35 am - Pooja: he took from tb
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: you treat earth as fprime frame
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: as moving away
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: can you check my proton ka answer
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: so
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: what you said
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: in f prime frame
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: total energy was 4 * m * c^2
03/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: now in f itll be same
03/09/20, 2:36 am - mehul mathur: so in f it was just one proton moving
03/09/20, 2:36 am - mehul mathur: so energy is gamma * m * c ^2
03/09/20, 2:36 am - mehul mathur: so gamma = 4
03/09/20, 2:36 am - mehul mathur: so now we can get v
03/09/20, 2:36 am - mehul mathur: but we didnt use v prime
03/09/20, 2:37 am - mehul mathur: and sorry i got v as sqrt(15) / 4 * c
03/09/20, 2:38 am - Pooja: I think thats right
03/09/20, 2:38 am - Pooja: Bc that gives 9.69
03/09/20, 2:38 am - Pooja: Idk if this a correct approach tho
03/09/20, 2:38 am - mehul mathur: what?
03/09/20, 2:38 am - Pooja: Seems right to me but im really not sure
03/09/20, 2:38 am - mehul mathur: sqrt(15) is smaller than 4 bro
03/09/20, 2:39 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 2:39 am - Pooja: Typo meand
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: ya you said 9.69
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: ok
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: yeah so this is correct approach na
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: is this question in tb
03/09/20, 2:39 am - Pooja: bro
03/09/20, 2:39 am - Pooja: Idk
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: and now that we know v and v prime
03/09/20, 2:39 am - Pooja: Im dumb
03/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: we can now know F prime ka velocity
03/09/20, 2:40 am - mehul mathur: stop being humble stfu
03/09/20, 2:41 am - Pooja: theres a similar question
03/09/20, 2:41 am - Pooja: But asks diff thing
03/09/20, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: Ok you wanna do science tb questions today?
03/09/20, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: After reading
03/09/20, 2:45 am - Pooja: Ill see
03/09/20, 2:49 am - Pooja: Its not on slader
03/09/20, 2:49 am - Pooja: have fun
03/09/20, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: Fuckk
03/09/20, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: Cheggs maybe
03/09/20, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: But that's paid
03/09/20, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: Have you considered contributing to get a cheggs membership
03/09/20, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: One email
03/09/20, 2:51 am - Pooja: Idk whay cheggs
03/09/20, 2:51 am - Pooja: Is
03/09/20, 2:51 am - Pooja: But im not paying for stuff and all
03/09/20, 2:51 am - mehul mathur: Has like detailed solutions
03/09/20, 2:51 am - mehul mathur: For books
03/09/20, 4:26 am - Pooja: Remind me to submit group ass pls
03/09/20, 4:26 am - Pooja: The doc isnt finished
03/09/20, 4:26 am - Pooja: We wrote stuff out so badly
03/09/20, 4:48 am - mehul mathur: okk
03/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: any of you tried history or nightswatch
03/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: ?
03/09/20, 7:24 am - Pooja: Mehul what was that last rocket problem
03/09/20, 7:24 am - Pooja: Idek what the question was
03/09/20, 7:26 am - mehul mathur: uhh
03/09/20, 7:26 am - Pooja: Mehulmehulmehul
03/09/20, 7:27 am - mehul mathur: so a rocket is going up with velocity vr lets say
03/09/20, 7:27 am - mehul mathur: its doing so by emmiting gases at a velocity vg from its base in the opposite direction
03/09/20, 7:27 am - mehul mathur: m * dvr/dt + dm/dt * vg = m*g
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: then he said
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: if vg is veryy high
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: like in terms of c and all
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: so what equation do we get for vr at a time t
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: i dont know how to approach
03/09/20, 7:28 am - mehul mathur: but thats the problem
03/09/20, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: any idea?
03/09/20, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: you read book?
03/09/20, 7:29 am - Pooja: stfu wait let me process
03/09/20, 7:30 am - Pooja: Why =mg?
03/09/20, 7:30 am - Pooja: What is m there
03/09/20, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: thats the wait of the rocket ba
03/09/20, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: na
03/09/20, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: so it has to be atleast equal to weight to lift it up
03/09/20, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: rockets mass at that point
03/09/20, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: of time
03/09/20, 7:30 am - Pooja: Ok ok
03/09/20, 7:31 am - Pooja: Hmmm soooo
03/09/20, 7:31 am - Pooja: Maybe we could use energy conservation?
03/09/20, 7:31 am - Pooja: Just thinking out loud no idea where to go
03/09/20, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: thats the complete thought?
03/09/20, 7:32 am - Pooja: Like rhs
03/09/20, 7:32 am - Pooja: When its at rest
03/09/20, 7:32 am - Pooja: Tot energy is just mc2
03/09/20, 7:32 am - Pooja: And lhs when its in motion
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: gamma * m * c^2
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: when in motion
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: but theres gas also
03/09/20, 7:33 am - Pooja: Arey but with differentials and stuff
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: with vg
03/09/20, 7:33 am - Pooja: Not sure
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: so that also has its own gamma(vg) * m * c^2
03/09/20, 7:33 am - mehul mathur: ya im just like adding to what youre saying i dont know how to do this XD
03/09/20, 7:33 am - Pooja: Vg is ~ c right
03/09/20, 7:34 am - mehul mathur: he said like
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: Not vr
03/09/20, 7:34 am - mehul mathur: consider moles of gas
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: So we dont really care about gamma there
03/09/20, 7:34 am - mehul mathur: too
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: Rocket neva gonna go as fast lightttt
03/09/20, 7:34 am - mehul mathur: arey he said close to c not like ~ jitna close
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: Sujr
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: Sukr
03/09/20, 7:34 am - mehul mathur: like 0.3c , 0.6 c like that
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: yeah ig we only care for vg
03/09/20, 7:34 am - Pooja: Even .3 is imposing
03/09/20, 7:35 am - Pooja: Impossible
03/09/20, 7:35 am - mehul mathur: this equation is in classical physics without considering relativity
03/09/20, 7:35 am - mehul mathur: bro its hypothetical problem
03/09/20, 7:35 am - Pooja: basically what we ve done so far
03/09/20, 7:35 am - Pooja: In every problem
03/09/20, 7:35 am - Pooja: Is replace classical terms with this shit
03/09/20, 7:36 am - Pooja: Arey you only said
03/09/20, 7:36 am - Pooja: ...
03/09/20, 7:36 am - mehul mathur: ya but ok but what to do with frames and shit
03/09/20, 7:36 am - mehul mathur: i asked on the chat that do we need to alter frames and he looked like i said the dumbest thing
03/09/20, 7:36 am - mehul mathur: also
03/09/20, 7:36 am - mehul mathur: i did history
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: big flex
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: achha tell thenn
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: how to solve thiss
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: tell it seems
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: My ass
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: Good bye
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: arey
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: I asked so i could finish writing notes
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: tata
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: it seems correct
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: haw
03/09/20, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: you used me
03/09/20, 7:37 am - Pooja: We didnt come up with anything yet😂😂
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Can you fix the doc bro
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Make it good
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Analysis
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Like proper sentences
03/09/20, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: its good na what to fix
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Then we ll submit that
03/09/20, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: ya ok
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: bro its not
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: Are you kidding
03/09/20, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: but you have er diagram pdf ready?
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: its too confusing stuff
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: yeah
03/09/20, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: ha ok ok ill do
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: ig like mention
03/09/20, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: also how will you write the rocket problem in notes?
03/09/20, 7:38 am - Pooja: In pdf they gave subheading of what to analyse
03/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: whats the keyword?
03/09/20, 7:39 am - Pooja: So before describing write that off
03/09/20, 7:39 am - Pooja: rocket problem
03/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
03/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: ok
03/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: didnt understand
03/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: you mean write headings like  - incorrectly included , and all that?
03/09/20, 7:44 am - Pooja: Yuppp
03/09/20, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: ok ill do in a few
03/09/20, 7:45 am - Pooja: Yogay
03/09/20, 7:45 am - Pooja: Ill send er pdf
03/09/20, 7:45 am - Pooja: Can you combine them when done and submit?
03/09/20, 7:45 am - Pooja: use some online convertor
03/09/20, 7:46 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 7:48 am - mehul mathur: okk
03/09/20, 7:48 am - Pooja: peacee
03/09/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: @918605936547 its due at 11 not 11:55 just fyi
03/09/20, 10:00 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
03/09/20, 10:00 am - mehul mathur: Vaibhav kasera
03/09/20, 10:42 am - Manasvi💩: How easy is it to design the ER model with these set of requirements?
03/09/20, 10:42 am - Manasvi💩: we didnt do this
03/09/20, 10:42 am - Manasvi💩: for the assignemnt
03/09/20, 10:45 am - Pooja: Oi submitted?
03/09/20, 10:45 am - Pooja: Subclass was wrong
03/09/20, 10:46 am - mehul mathur: Don't have to
03/09/20, 10:46 am - Manasvi💩: ok fine
03/09/20, 10:46 am - mehul mathur: Wait send link here

04/09/20, 4:56 am - mehul mathur: our 4-ary was different from the rest
04/09/20, 4:57 am - Pooja: I think ours was more unique than mallikas tbh
04/09/20, 4:57 am - Pooja: did we do that?
04/09/20, 4:57 am - Pooja: We did with all no lol
04/09/20, 4:57 am - Pooja: That was the confusion
04/09/20, 4:58 am - mehul mathur: Guest : min,max : (0,n) , partial participation
	Guests can go on as many relationships as they’d like.

Tourist Guide : min,max : (0,n), partial participation
Each tourist guide has to be a part of one trip at least, and can also be part of many separate trips.

Location: min,max : (0,n), total participation
	A location can be visited by none to any number of guests

Transport : min,max : (0,n), total participation 
A car may or may not be used, hence the min is 0 and can be used by many guests, hence max is unlimited.
04/09/20, 4:58 am - mehul mathur: bro this
04/09/20, 4:58 am - mehul mathur: i think bhavyajeet is saying this only
04/09/20, 4:58 am - mehul mathur: Guests can go on as many relationships as they’d like.
04/09/20, 4:58 am - mehul mathur: wtff
04/09/20, 5:02 am - Pooja: We wrote relationships??😂😂😂😂
04/09/20, 5:02 am - Pooja: bro we re fkn retarted
04/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: yup
04/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: bro wth
04/09/20, 5:02 am - Pooja: restlessness
04/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: i clearly wrote like guest can take any car go to any location
04/09/20, 5:02 am - Pooja: Didnt even read pdf before submitting
04/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: someone erased
04/09/20, 5:02 am - mehul mathur: plus this:  A location can be visited by none to any number of guests
04/09/20, 5:03 am - Pooja: Thats fine
04/09/20, 5:03 am - mehul mathur: should have been location can be visited by any guest using any car and tourguid
04/09/20, 5:03 am - Pooja: Oh binary
04/09/20, 5:03 am - mehul mathur: cuz that looks like only location and guest are connected
04/09/20, 5:03 am - Pooja: Yeah so in the doc for wr
04/09/20, 5:03 am - Pooja: Er
04/09/20, 5:03 am - mehul mathur: no 4 ary me we wrote thatt
04/09/20, 5:03 am - Pooja: We can mention that constraint is meant for that
04/09/20, 5:03 am - mehul mathur: ?
04/09/20, 5:03 am - mehul mathur: you know why its 0,n on location side na
04/09/20, 5:04 am - mehul mathur: that means location can be visited by any guest in any car using any tour guide
04/09/20, 5:04 am - mehul mathur: not just location can be visited by any guest
04/09/20, 5:04 am - Pooja: Yeah i know
04/09/20, 5:04 am - Pooja: thats what we meant
04/09/20, 5:04 am - Pooja: We just wrote wrong
04/09/20, 5:04 am - mehul mathur: yeah but we didnt write
04/09/20, 5:04 am - mehul mathur: ha
04/09/20, 5:05 am - Pooja: so we ll describe it properly in phase 2 doc im saying na
04/09/20, 5:05 am - Pooja: Nothing else we can do now lol
04/09/20, 5:05 am - mehul mathur: phase 2 doc we need to write what?
04/09/20, 5:06 am - Pooja: changes
04/09/20, 12:56 pm - Pooja: Do your background proccess print to terminal?
04/09/20, 12:57 pm - Pooja: Like what does ls & do
04/09/20, 12:58 pm - mehul mathur: ls and all they said they won't check background
04/09/20, 12:58 pm - mehul mathur: But yeah technically ls & should print
04/09/20, 12:58 pm - mehul mathur: Background processes still have access to stdout
04/09/20, 12:58 pm - mehul mathur: It's their access to stdin that you wanna take away
04/09/20, 12:59 pm - mehul mathur: For that you need to change their group id basically
04/09/20, 12:59 pm - Pooja: right
04/09/20, 12:59 pm - Pooja: I saw this stack overflow post
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - Pooja: It just used change groupid and then use waitpid to make sure no zombie proccesses
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - Pooja: Thats it right?
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - Pooja: what is all this linked list stuff kunwar and aakash keep talking about?
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: LINKED LIST IS BEST
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: i used
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: it
04/09/20, 1:00 pm - mehul mathur: very convenient
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: asked the tas also they also nodded
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: basically
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: when child comes back
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: and you handle its SIGCHLD signal
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: you also need to show its name
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: so
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: when you reap a zombie process with waitpid
04/09/20, 1:01 pm - mehul mathur: you cant access its name with its pid anymore
04/09/20, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: so you have to have it stored in a data structure
04/09/20, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: you also need to use the list to kill any remaining background processes you didnt take care of if you exit your shell
04/09/20, 1:11 pm - Pooja: Waitpid returns pid value right
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - mehul mathur: Correct
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - Pooja: so instead of linked list why dont we store some kinda set?
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - mehul mathur: Set ?
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - mehul mathur: In c?
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - Pooja: or some array or something
04/09/20, 1:12 pm - mehul mathur: Ya I did that before but the problem is
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: Array is not dynamic allocation
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - Pooja: Can you do array with two values in c
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: You mean array of structs yes you can
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: But thiss
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: Is main problem
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: Like if you spawn 50 bg processes
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - Pooja: Waittt
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - Pooja: This ps command thingy
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - mehul mathur: Ha
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - Pooja: Gives name along with pid right
04/09/20, 1:13 pm - Pooja: So why cant we take from that?
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: Arey but
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: It's not there
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: When it's a zombie
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - Pooja: We re never going to leave it as a zombie right
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - Pooja: We will always terminate with wait
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - Pooja: Its either running or not
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: After zombie it terminates only then toh it disappears obv na
04/09/20, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: Like ps won't have it
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: Nor will proc
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - Pooja: Ah
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - Pooja: I seee
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: There is a way of getting it through the signal itself by using a sigaction struct thingy
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: But
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: That has its own problems
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: That's why they are crying on that group
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: Just use linked lost
04/09/20, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: List
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - mehul mathur: And forgetta about itt
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: They cry all the time
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Or wh
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Wb
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: We can save the name before it terminates
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: And then use it after it terminates
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - mehul mathur: What is before terminates Baba
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Like before calling wait
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Wait terminates this thing
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: I dont want it to terminate yet
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - mehul mathur: Waitpid
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Get name using pid
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - mehul mathur: Not wait
04/09/20, 1:16 pm - Pooja: Wait also terminates
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: Whatever same thing you get what im saying
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - mehul mathur: Arey bhai that wait is for foreground
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - mehul mathur: Wait PID with those flags is for background
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: yeah yeah ik
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: By wait i meant waitpid onlt
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - mehul mathur: How will you do this before waitpid
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: Ok telll
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: Whats wrong
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - mehul mathur: Waitpid returns pid
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: Before i call waitpud
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: Waitpid
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - Pooja: I say get name of process with this pid
04/09/20, 1:17 pm - mehul mathur: Howowowow
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - Pooja: There should be some way of getting pid without using wait
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Bro listen
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - Pooja: lemme seee
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Waitpid gives pid
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - Pooja: yaa got that
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Before waitpid how will you magically get pid
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Without using complicated signal structs you cant
04/09/20, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Honestly linked list is small ass code
04/09/20, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: Want me to send insert and delete functions?
04/09/20, 2:24 pm - Pooja: Nono let me try by myself first

05/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: i mean side with cheaters as in like if people are getting mad and trying not to get caught that is ok
05/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: we cant say like whats the point you deserve it
05/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: we aint god
05/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: do you not think cheating is wrong though
05/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: like we do it
05/09/20, 2:19 am - Pooja: But that doesnt make it not wrong
05/09/20, 2:20 am - mehul mathur: wrong or right is perspective wise na
05/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: you can say cheating is against the rules of the quiz
05/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: wrong and right is opinion
05/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: this is a fact par
05/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: im saying cheating is morally wrong
05/09/20, 2:21 am - mehul mathur: im saying morals is person to person
05/09/20, 2:21 am - Pooja: its not that subjective like youre not supposed to cheat on a test
05/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: if you do youre breaking rule
05/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Hence wrong
05/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Idk man whatever
05/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: ya cuz all tests have that rule so you were made to think that its morally wrong
05/09/20, 2:22 am - mehul mathur: arey dont get mad tho i like these discussions
05/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: Like i get the point its hard
05/09/20, 2:22 am - Pooja: To study this much
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: But when you cheat and get caught
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Its kinda funny to get mad that youll face consequences now xD
05/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: you should make zero effort to defend
05/09/20, 2:23 am - mehul mathur: ?
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: im not even saying right or wrong im just saying like
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: We know issa risk
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: we did it anyway
05/09/20, 2:23 am - Pooja: Defend what you know is wrong?
05/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: "you" know its wrong
05/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: prolly they didnt think that
05/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: one could say its too hard so its justified
05/09/20, 2:24 am - mehul mathur: cuz there must be some difficulty level after which youll think like okay i "have" to cheat
05/09/20, 2:25 am - mehul mathur: so basically wrong and right becomes suuper subjective then
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: its not subjective
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Cheating is against rule
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Break rule
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Thats wrong
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: Thats a fact na how can your argue that
05/09/20, 2:26 am - mehul mathur: break rule is wrong is a fact?
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: No everyone who cheats is wrong its just the pros outweigh the cons
05/09/20, 2:26 am - Pooja: yes
05/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: cons will outweigh if you do nothing
05/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: like you said na
05/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: theyll face consequences
05/09/20, 2:27 am - mehul mathur: and they shouldnt even try to defend now
05/09/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: im saying like if they do manage to get away everytime
05/09/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: what then?
05/09/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: then pros > cons
05/09/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: get easy answers to quiz and face nothing
05/09/20, 2:28 am - mehul mathur: but you were saying why are they even arguing just accept it
05/09/20, 2:29 am - mehul mathur: manasvi stop reading and give input also
05/09/20, 2:33 am - Manasvi💩: lite

05/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: you cant be in the middle
05/09/20, 2:35 am - Manasvi💩: deal with it means defend yourself
05/09/20, 2:35 am - Manasvi💩: but you just look stupid

05/09/20, 7:08 am - mehul mathur: achha ok
05/09/20, 7:09 am - mehul mathur: few things that were unambigous in req doc
05/09/20, 7:09 am - mehul mathur: pooja you have it open rn
05/09/20, 7:09 am - mehul mathur: so for family weak entity relationship
05/09/20, 7:10 am - mehul mathur: guest is (0,1) which we explained as a guest having zero or no family
05/09/20, 7:10 am - mehul mathur: now family has name and age
05/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: we didnt write them as multivalued attributes
05/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: cuz like names means all names of children and elderly
05/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: like in one row we include all names of all elders and children geddit?
05/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: same for age
05/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: so we can specify that here
05/09/20, 7:12 am - mehul mathur: also clarification why location , and all also have 0,n in the 4-ary one
05/09/20, 7:12 am - mehul mathur: those 2 so far we can write in phase 2
05/09/20, 7:14 am - mehul mathur: helllooo
05/09/20, 7:14 am - mehul mathur: come onlineene
05/09/20, 7:20 am - mehul mathur: ohand we also didnt show anything for overlapping or disjoint
05/09/20, 7:22 am - mehul mathur: we didnt write it in req doc also
05/09/20, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNPZ_9DoF7F73IPiFD532bUUBxwQ0EqYZ_qbFhqLS_g/edit
05/09/20, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: heres the doc finished
05/09/20, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
05/09/20, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: heres the final thing
05/09/20, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: check it out
05/09/20, 9:03 am - Pooja: Looks good
05/09/20, 9:03 am - Pooja: Are you sure about family name and age being multivalued?
05/09/20, 9:04 am - mehul mathur: Yeah na cuz that name means all names of all members
05/09/20, 9:04 am - mehul mathur: Under one column
05/09/20, 9:04 am - mehul mathur: We aren't doing like 1 child is 1 entity
05/09/20, 9:08 am - Pooja: Family is entity
05/09/20, 9:08 am - Pooja: So its one table
05/09/20, 9:08 am - Pooja: And has attributes name and age
05/09/20, 9:09 am - Pooja: So each fam member is its own row na?
05/09/20, 9:09 am - Pooja: idk how to represent weak entities in table tho
05/09/20, 9:11 am - mehul mathur: Arey but in guest family relationship guest is (0,1)
05/09/20, 9:11 am - mehul mathur: That means a guest can be related to max only one family entity
05/09/20, 9:12 am - Pooja: ohh ok
05/09/20, 9:12 am - Pooja: Yeah makes sense then
05/09/20, 9:12 am - Pooja: Ig submit?
05/09/20, 9:12 am - mehul mathur: So that means I have to relate guest to whole family at once

07/09/20, 1:57 am - mehul mathur: i didnt write that if kernel is more than processors then itll exhaust system resources
07/09/20, 1:57 am - mehul mathur: but that question is so unclear
07/09/20, 1:57 am - mehul mathur: just saying a statement is not enough
07/09/20, 1:58 am - mehul mathur: like they didnt say like should i explain why is that , or what are issues with that
07/09/20, 1:58 am - mehul mathur: anything
07/09/20, 2:01 am - Pooja: yeah i got and explain the implications of before the statement
07/09/20, 2:01 am - Pooja: *an
07/09/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: ohhhh
07/09/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: see yeah i dint get that
07/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: You also got late?
07/09/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: so wait you wrote this kya
07/09/20, 2:02 am - mehul mathur: na i got at 11:28 lol
07/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: They messed up the ready papers also ayo
07/09/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: I thought late ones they were stressed did dumb copy paste
07/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: wait wdym copy paste copy paste of what?
07/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: I had diff question
07/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: like questions
07/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Yeah
07/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: no you just had if they were equal na
07/09/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: like kernel threads = processors
07/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Yeah you had more
07/09/20, 2:03 am - Pooja: Why will equal exhaust any resources
07/09/20, 2:05 am - mehul mathur: ya ya they wont
07/09/20, 2:05 am - mehul mathur: but like so what did you write
07/09/20, 2:05 am - mehul mathur: less than user threads you had?
07/09/20, 2:05 am - mehul mathur: so that means some user threads might need to wait their turn right?
07/09/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: but equal to processors what you write about that
07/09/20, 2:06 am - Pooja: yeahg
07/09/20, 2:06 am - Pooja: I explained above na
07/09/20, 2:06 am - Pooja: That only
07/09/20, 2:06 am - mehul mathur: ugh ok ill scroll "above"
07/09/20, 2:07 am - mehul mathur: ok this na
07/09/20, 3:05 am - mehul mathur: abey yaar phase 3
07/09/20, 3:07 am - Pooja: the pdf didnt come yet tho
07/09/20, 3:07 am - mehul mathur: yeah but due date next monday
07/09/20, 3:08 am - Pooja: Tuesday

07/09/20, 3:10 am - mehul mathur: when hes talking
07/09/20, 3:13 am - Pooja: signal sux maybe
07/09/20, 3:14 am - mehul mathur: bro hes teaching 68 people
07/09/20, 3:14 am - mehul mathur: the angrier he gets over this
07/09/20, 3:15 am - mehul mathur: quizzes will be harder
07/09/20, 3:16 am - Pooja: i dont think he sets questions
07/09/20, 3:16 am - mehul mathur: Might have a say in it thi
07/09/20, 3:16 am - mehul mathur: They have to show him
07/09/20, 10:49 am - Pooja: 9 30?
07/09/20, 10:50 am - Pooja: we re giving?
07/09/20, 10:50 am - Manasvi💩: 45
07/09/20, 10:50 am - Manasvi💩: please
07/09/20, 10:50 am - mehul mathur: I'll be on discord at 30
07/09/20, 10:50 am - mehul mathur: With aakash and aakash
07/09/20, 10:50 am - mehul mathur: You all give after that I'll tell
07/09/20, 10:51 am - Pooja: what

07/09/20, 10:53 am - Pooja: 45
07/09/20, 10:53 am - Manasvi💩: yep
07/09/20, 11:29 am - mehul mathur: bro this was a disaster
07/09/20, 11:39 am - Pooja: I don't even what was right or not
07/09/20, 11:40 am - mehul mathur: the vaguest questions possible
07/09/20, 11:40 am - Pooja: Its badly worded
07/09/20, 11:50 am - mehul mathur: ok so are we discussing anything about algo project today or tommorrow?
07/09/20, 11:52 am - Pooja: wait so everyone ditched religion project?
07/09/20, 11:52 am - mehul mathur: Ya everyone kept going turn by turn giving formal goodbyes😂
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: I mean there's still people on the group tho
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: Oh manasvi is still there
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: And aman and raghav
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: Shivansh and all
07/09/20, 11:53 am - Manasvi💩: no
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: Oh you left ok
07/09/20, 11:53 am - mehul mathur: Bro what was this fucking quiz
07/09/20, 11:54 am - mehul mathur: What did you write for key constraint is : wala
07/09/20, 12:12 pm - Pooja: Mehul
07/09/20, 12:12 pm - Pooja: Did you use wait and waitpid in code
07/09/20, 12:12 pm - Pooja: Wait for foreground and waitpid for background
07/09/20, 12:12 pm - mehul mathur: Yep
07/09/20, 12:12 pm - mehul mathur: Yepyep
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: it didnt get seg fault???
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: Give
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - mehul mathur: No why?
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: its giving ne
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: Me
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - mehul mathur: Wait where is it giving?
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: foreground processes call signal handler functions too
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: When they terminate
07/09/20, 12:13 pm - Pooja: So waitpid and wait gets called for that
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - mehul mathur: There's more chances it gives seg fault on some string shit than wait and all
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - mehul mathur: Arey but you only wait if foreground is there
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - Pooja: so you call wait twice for foreground?
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - mehul mathur: Like if you don't see an & then don't do wait(null)
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - Pooja: wait and waitpid
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - mehul mathur: Just once
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - Pooja: No i mean
07/09/20, 12:14 pm - Pooja: For foreground
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: Youre calling wait and waitpid
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - mehul mathur: For foreground no waitpid bro
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: Areyyyyy
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: When foreground process ends
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - mehul mathur: Only wait(null) for foreground
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: Signal will be sent
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: You cant do anything about that
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: So waitpid will get called then na
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - mehul mathur: Yeah wait(null) takes care of that
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - mehul mathur: Not eaipid
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - mehul mathur: Waitpid
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: ....
07/09/20, 12:15 pm - Pooja: bc its a child process
07/09/20, 12:16 pm - mehul mathur: Yaa but that signal wait handles
07/09/20, 12:16 pm - mehul mathur: Not waitpid
07/09/20, 12:16 pm - mehul mathur: Tell me how you used wait
07/09/20, 12:17 pm - Pooja: Wait one sec ill finish
07/09/20, 12:17 pm - Pooja: Dinner
07/09/20, 12:17 pm - mehul mathur: Theekeke
07/09/20, 12:18 pm - mehul mathur: Can you call if possible on text it'll be hard
07/09/20, 12:18 pm - mehul mathur: Or like screen share
07/09/20, 12:19 pm - Pooja: Yeah okay
07/09/20, 12:37 pm - mehul mathur: @919980677602 ?

07/09/20, 12:44 pm - mehul mathur: Cool
08/09/20, 1:14 am - mehul mathur: aah im okay with all questions except rocket one
08/09/20, 1:14 am - mehul mathur: he never explained tht fully
08/09/20, 1:35 am - Pooja: 200 people in class
08/09/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: ikk
08/09/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: people also thought that feedback form was gonna be quiz lol
08/09/20, 2:18 am - mehul mathur: where is the form?
08/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: Oii
08/09/20, 2:20 am - Pooja: What are birthday bumps called in college

08/09/20, 2:33 am - Pooja: I havent published any only yett
08/09/20, 2:33 am - mehul mathur: Nyope
08/09/20, 2:33 am - mehul mathur: Prolly something from m I don't remember
08/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: Publishhsh karo
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: ok wait \
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: guys
08/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: /
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: lets make a database
08/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: \
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: for aad project
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: well have to implement a lot of data structures
08/09/20, 2:34 am - mehul mathur: but thats not the intention
08/09/20, 2:34 am - Manasvi💩: pleaseeee
08/09/20, 2:35 am - Manasvi💩: can we do this
08/09/20, 2:35 am - Manasvi💩: database system
08/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: Why do you want to implement a lot of data structures the hell
08/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: That's not what he wants
08/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: Wheres algos in that
08/09/20, 2:35 am - mehul mathur: Analysis?
08/09/20, 2:37 am - Manasvi💩: no da
08/09/20, 2:37 am - Manasvi💩: obviously youll use algorithms
08/09/20, 2:38 am - Manasvi💩: to build the software
08/09/20, 2:38 am - Pooja: ay why database againn
08/09/20, 2:38 am - Manasvi💩: well be using b trees
08/09/20, 2:38 am - Manasvi💩: range quries
08/09/20, 2:38 am - mehul mathur: Database is very boring
08/09/20, 2:38 am - mehul mathur: Data structures
08/09/20, 2:39 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: Not algos bro
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: And you are saying implementation
08/09/20, 2:39 am - Manasvi💩: there are da
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: No analysis
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: He didn't say just code using algos
08/09/20, 2:39 am - Manasvi💩: bro therell be so much analysis in this da
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: Like?
08/09/20, 2:39 am - Manasvi💩: can you read up once on this
08/09/20, 2:39 am - mehul mathur: What read up
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: just look up online
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: how to build a databse software
08/09/20, 2:40 am - mehul mathur: Bro you just want to code data structures I don't know why
08/09/20, 2:40 am - mehul mathur: Well do that in da
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: fine lite then
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: whatever
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: no were notttt
08/09/20, 2:40 am - mehul mathur: Ofc phase 4
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: were using the software there
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: here im saying lets build the software
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: these are 2
08/09/20, 2:40 am - Manasvi💩: different things
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: Arey toh chal theeke but why do you think code of data base is a algo and analysis project idea
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: Send link I mean what you want us to read
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: But like
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: Why is coding so many data structures attractive to you
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: I don't get
08/09/20, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: That's not primary objective of project
08/09/20, 2:41 am - Manasvi💩: he didnt specify
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Manasvi💩: he sid do what you want
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Manasvi💩: said
08/09/20, 2:42 am - mehul mathur: Bro what you saying would be a good dsa project
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Pooja: I mean
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Pooja: Obviously you have to use algos
08/09/20, 2:42 am - mehul mathur: B-trees red black tress all that shit where is analysis there
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
08/09/20, 2:42 am - Pooja: Data structures by themselves whatll you do
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: but im not soooo excited
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Manasvi💩: yes exactly
08/09/20, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: Literally all code is algos you know. A
08/09/20, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: Like anything
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Manasvi💩: but
08/09/20, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: Summing an array is algos
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: Databases use efficient algos
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: To search up things
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: Not o(n) og
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: Ig
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Manasvi💩: segemnt tree and b trees
08/09/20, 2:43 am - Pooja: Idk svi send a link to what youre talking about?
08/09/20, 3:07 am - Pooja: Ayo
08/09/20, 3:07 am - Pooja: Is p and s tut now

08/09/20, 3:08 am - Pooja: No
08/09/20, 3:21 am - Manasvi💩: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/121653/create-my-own-database-system
08/09/20, 3:30 am - mehul mathur: group 2 tutorial started
08/09/20, 12:23 pm - Pooja: We need background for cd and ls too?
08/09/20, 12:24 pm - Manasvi💩: no
08/09/20, 12:24 pm - Pooja: Pakks?
08/09/20, 12:24 pm - Manasvi💩: yes
08/09/20, 12:24 pm - Pooja: Ly
09/09/20, 12:13 am - mehul mathur: what is XZZZ
09/09/20, 12:13 am - mehul mathur: is it X multiplied by Z
09/09/20, 2:30 am - mehul mathur: ok phase 3 came
09/09/20, 2:30 am - mehul mathur: they said that read from chapter 9 and 14 to know how to do it
09/09/20, 2:31 am - mehul mathur: so lets do that and meet tomm
09/09/20, 2:31 am - Pooja: Ok
09/09/20, 2:37 am - mehul mathur: guys join the algo tut
09/09/20, 11:27 pm - mehul mathur: ok so @919980677602 we need 2 more members atleast
09/09/20, 11:27 pm - mehul mathur: and also we can do an algo visualizer
09/09/20, 11:29 pm - mehul mathur: or we stick to making a youtube channel or something
09/09/20, 11:30 pm - Manasvi💩: No youtube da
09/09/20, 11:32 pm - Pooja: no yt yeah
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: ha see cuz we can make it much more than a visualizer
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: we can make it much more interactive like you see the timee
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: or like you can see the algos old naive ways
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: and then the latest fastest way
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - Pooja: it seems it would take a lot of time
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: and then for the algo we can have a short section of written stuff for analysis
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - Pooja: We d need a way bigger team
09/09/20, 11:33 pm - mehul mathur: we can make this just for graph algos also
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: i mean yeah we need 2 more members now toh for sure
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: making the visualizer would take a lot of time
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: No we dont
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: He said less than 5 over 15 also okay
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: he said 5 to 15
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: Yeah then he said this
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: but bigger teams are better
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: yeah but then how do we form sub teams and all in 3 members bro
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: Wdm it'll take too much tome
09/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: yeah
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: Lets pick one good idea
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: We got 3 months
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: no ma
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: We have one and a half
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - mehul mathur: 1.5
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: Oh what
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: Arre
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: But still you think it'll rake a lot of time?
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: And we ll keep putting it off bc no proper middle deadlines
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: Its coding heavy na
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - mehul mathur: wait why you suprised you know we are 10 days into sept
09/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: We ll have to figure it out
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: can we do some thing thatll look cool on resumes lol
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Manasvi💩: This would right
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Manasvi💩: Algo vosualizer looks great
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: yeahh
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: It sounds good
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: But not thatt exciting
09/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: If we dont come up with anything else im down tho
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - mehul mathur: so hes saying theory is important
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Manasvi💩: Yeah exactly
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Pooja: to make this we 100% need theory
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Pooja: like its all theory
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Manasvi💩: No?
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Manasvi💩: We just need to implement the algo right
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Pooja: yeah no to visualise it properly we need to know how it works
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - mehul mathur: wait no visualizer me we need to show everything about algo right
09/09/20, 11:37 pm - Pooja: If each step goes one by one
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - Pooja: We need to know how algo works properly not just end product
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - Manasvi💩: But like where are we analysing why it works
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - Manasvi💩: And the complexity
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - Pooja: maybe we can have a page to each visualisation
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - Pooja: Explaining that stuff
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - mehul mathur: thats what im saying we can show the time and all also it took
09/09/20, 11:38 pm - mehul mathur: and explaining stuff we can have a text section
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - Pooja: actually i kinda like this lets do it
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: or maybe we can record voices of us explaining while the user plays the visualizer
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - Pooja: can we pitch it to other people expand team?
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: ohhohoohhh
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: yeyeyyye
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - Pooja: chee no xD
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - Manasvi💩: ok yeah
09/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: arey why well have like us speak in heavy accent while user plays the thing
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Pooja: nobody wants to listen to our voices lol
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Pooja: Keep it clazzy
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Pooja: okkk so pitch offfff
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Manasvi💩: stop lol
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Pooja: who we talking to
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - mehul mathur: achha ok point was we have a section for explaining na and that can be more than text
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Manasvi💩: who we talking to
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - mehul mathur: soo should i put on broo fugall?
09/09/20, 11:40 pm - Pooja: Did you copy or
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - Manasvi💩: my phone is slow
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - Pooja: our brain is the same
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - mehul mathur: no you guys are the same person duh
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - Manasvi💩: yee pooja
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - Pooja: you started saying duh bc of us lmaooo
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - Manasvi💩: 😂😂
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - mehul mathur: ya becuz duh is something i didnt know before
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - mehul mathur: what?
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - mehul mathur: duh is so common
09/09/20, 11:41 pm - mehul mathur: dont take that much credit also in influencing me
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Pooja: I actually believed this
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Pooja: maam i have video proof
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Manasvi💩: a girl said it to me in 8th grade
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Pooja: hannah montana said it to me
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - mehul mathur: ??
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Pooja: whatever
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Manasvi💩: i was mesmerized
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - Pooja: Ok i feel like this might be common projectt thoooo
09/09/20, 11:42 pm - mehul mathur: hannah montana says "say whaaat"
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - Manasvi💩: nooooo fuck all of them
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - Manasvi💩: well do
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - mehul mathur: arey do we have time to be out of the box now
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - mehul mathur: basic proj = easy to do
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - mehul mathur: but i mean lets keep this idea as our pitch
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - mehul mathur: but we can try for 2 days for any other
09/09/20, 11:43 pm - mehul mathur: achha but
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - mehul mathur: team memberss
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - mehul mathur: who we ask
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - Manasvi💩: recruit
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - Manasvi💩: ask some smart people
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - Manasvi💩: dhruv kapoor has a team?
09/09/20, 11:44 pm - Manasvi💩: that guy knows a lot of web dev also
09/09/20, 11:45 pm - mehul mathur: i asked jain aakash
09/09/20, 11:45 pm - Manasvi💩: peace
09/09/20, 11:46 pm - Manasvi💩: theres this smart girl ananya
09/09/20, 11:46 pm - Manasvi💩: ill ask her?
09/09/20, 11:46 pm - Manasvi💩: if she has a team
09/09/20, 11:46 pm - Manasvi💩: or lite
09/09/20, 11:56 pm - mehul mathur: ok who you guys asking
09/09/20, 11:57 pm - Manasvi💩: but are we learning anything new
09/09/20, 11:58 pm - Manasvi💩: related to analysis
09/09/20, 11:58 pm - mehul mathur: arey i pitched to like 3-4 people already
10/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: i feel like in our visualizer shoeing them on each step the time it took (like was that step o(1) o (N)  , and spcae taken) and then having a section for proof and all
10/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: that is analysis enough na
10/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: see this idea leans more towards coding side i agree
10/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: that database idea leaned 100% to coding side
10/09/20, 12:00 am - mehul mathur: now if we can come up with one leaning towards theory side then ,ets try
10/09/20, 12:01 am - mehul mathur: but not more than 2 days
10/09/20, 12:01 am - Manasvi💩: yeah but we also wouldve learnt so much new
10/09/20, 12:01 am - mehul mathur: arey bro in the visualizer also we can take algos we didnt know before and all
10/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: problem in database is thats sayin we did analysis you believe us this is an implmentation
10/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: thats oonlly implementation
10/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: wonly
10/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: visualizer is atleast all the coding itself is to analyze
10/09/20, 12:02 am - Manasvi💩: ok im not saying we do the databse
10/09/20, 12:02 am - Manasvi💩: theres no time for that
10/09/20, 12:02 am - Manasvi💩: its too hard
10/09/20, 12:03 am - Manasvi💩: im just saying visualizer is kinda mediocre
10/09/20, 12:04 am - mehul mathur: we are medicore
10/09/20, 12:04 am - mehul mathur: medicoreXD
10/09/20, 12:04 am - Manasvi💩: mehul shutup no
10/09/20, 12:04 am - Manasvi💩: lmaooo
10/09/20, 12:04 am - Manasvi💩: i didnt notice
10/09/20, 12:05 am - Manasvi💩: ok lets recruit people
10/09/20, 12:05 am - Manasvi💩: and then we can come up with newer ideas
10/09/20, 12:05 am - Manasvi💩: whod you talk to?
10/09/20, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: ya but to recruit our pitch should be good
10/09/20, 12:05 am - Manasvi💩: no?
10/09/20, 12:06 am - Pooja: This isnt shark tank
10/09/20, 12:06 am - mehul mathur: see these ritvik,siddharth , arihant have a group
10/09/20, 12:06 am - mehul mathur: this shivansh is with vishwa and a;;
10/09/20, 12:06 am - Manasvi💩: oh
10/09/20, 12:06 am - mehul mathur: they need idea tho
10/09/20, 12:07 am - Manasvi💩: so we'll join their group
10/09/20, 12:07 am - Manasvi💩: and discuss
10/09/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: yeah they have 3 people only
10/09/20, 12:07 am - Manasvi💩: peace
10/09/20, 12:07 am - Manasvi💩: what about aakash jain?

10/09/20, 12:13 am - mehul mathur: so ive put proposal up for ritvik team to merge but they deciding
10/09/20, 12:13 am - mehul mathur: jain is coming with sriram
10/09/20, 12:15 am - Pooja: wb raghav and all
10/09/20, 12:16 am - mehul mathur: ill ask ill ask
10/09/20, 12:16 am - mehul mathur: so whenever i pitch idea
10/09/20, 12:17 am - mehul mathur: everyones main concern is like so does this represent what we learnt
10/09/20, 12:17 am - mehul mathur: it does right
10/09/20, 12:17 am - Pooja: ask whoever bigger team more we can expand project
10/09/20, 12:17 am - mehul mathur: we are literally breaking down lagos
10/09/20, 12:17 am - mehul mathur: algos
10/09/20, 12:17 am - Pooja: Yeah
10/09/20, 12:19 am - Manasvi💩: no but i feel like we're not learning anything new
10/09/20, 12:19 am - Manasvi💩: we already know how they work
10/09/20, 12:19 am - Manasvi💩: and we have a general idea of the proof
10/09/20, 12:21 am - mehul mathur: arey what does learning something new mean achha tell
10/09/20, 12:21 am - Manasvi💩: like see in this course we learnt about fft
10/09/20, 12:21 am - Manasvi💩: thats something we didnt know beforre
10/09/20, 12:21 am - Manasvi💩: thats what i mean
10/09/20, 12:22 am - Manasvi💩: honestly i think it depends on what kind of algos we try to implemnt ig
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: ha toh well visulize that na
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: doesnt have to be graphs
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: see
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: so ritvik will tell till evening if hes merging
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFVdHDMcepw&list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or&t=0s
10/09/20, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: ritvik sent this
10/09/20, 12:25 am - mehul mathur: idk what his idea in this is
10/09/20, 12:27 am - mehul mathur: but like i wann form team and then idea
10/09/20, 12:27 am - mehul mathur: so i told that you guys merge and then lets reject/accept ideas
10/09/20, 12:27 am - mehul mathur: hell tell in evening
10/09/20, 12:28 am - mehul mathur: but ive pitched visualizer to everyone
10/09/20, 12:28 am - mehul mathur: jain likes t
10/09/20, 12:28 am - mehul mathur: it
10/09/20, 12:28 am - mehul mathur: ritvik thinks its ok/good
10/09/20, 12:29 am - mehul mathur: and raghav we are asking
10/09/20, 12:55 am - mehul mathur: i missed science tut what happened?
10/09/20, 12:56 am - mehul mathur: science cancelled today
10/09/20, 12:57 am - mehul mathur: did you guys get that gradescope email?
10/09/20, 12:57 am - Manasvi💩: yeah
10/09/20, 12:57 am - mehul mathur: no like the account regiteration
10/09/20, 1:07 am - mehul mathur: okk ritvik merging yayyyyy
10/09/20, 1:08 am - mehul mathur: so we have jain , sriram , maybe raghav , ritvik , sid , arihant
10/09/20, 1:08 am - Manasvi💩: yaayy
10/09/20, 1:08 am - mehul mathur: i should be recruiter
10/09/20, 1:17 am - Pooja: Arey bro
10/09/20, 1:17 am - Pooja: lets all go with ideas we like
10/09/20, 1:17 am - mehul mathur: wdym
10/09/20, 1:17 am - Pooja: like dw too much about "team loyalty"or whatever
10/09/20, 1:17 am - Pooja: Rather than forming team and then coming up with idea
10/09/20, 1:17 am - Pooja: I think idea and then team makes more sense
10/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: but we formed to get more idea
10/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: i mean if they dont like visualizer idea im ready to let go of few members
10/09/20, 1:18 am - mehul mathur: like ill stick to it
10/09/20, 1:18 am - Pooja: yeah but if someone doesnt like it and others do
10/09/20, 1:18 am - Pooja: Then its okay
10/09/20, 1:18 am - Pooja: This is what happened with the religion idea too
10/09/20, 1:18 am - Pooja: Suddenly everyone backed out bc aakash did
10/09/20, 1:20 am - mehul mathur: becuz it was his idea only and they kept on adding stuff
10/09/20, 1:20 am - mehul mathur: lot of work
10/09/20, 1:20 am - mehul mathur: so when idea giver ditched
10/09/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: so they ditched
10/09/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: but this time we stick to this idea
10/09/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: whoever want to stay stays
10/09/20, 1:22 am - Pooja: no da even im not soo
10/09/20, 1:23 am - Pooja: Like excited about it rn
10/09/20, 1:23 am - Manasvi💩: lmao aakash
10/09/20, 1:24 am - mehul mathur: arey what lmao answer on group na
10/09/20, 1:24 am - mehul mathur: thats why we made team
10/09/20, 1:24 am - Manasvi💩: yeah but like he has a point
10/09/20, 1:25 am - Manasvi💩: we're not learning anything new from this
10/09/20, 1:25 am - Manasvi💩: execpt maybe react
10/09/20, 1:25 am - mehul mathur: bro you cant come up with idea then instantly reject
10/09/20, 1:25 am - mehul mathur: bro wtff
10/09/20, 1:25 am - mehul mathur: well choose algos we dont know
10/09/20, 1:25 am - Manasvi💩: bro i said this earlier also da
10/09/20, 1:25 am - Manasvi💩: yeah ok
10/09/20, 1:25 am - mehul mathur: what do you mean when you say learning neww
10/09/20, 1:26 am - Manasvi💩: see im just saying dont make this visualizer concrete
10/09/20, 1:26 am - Manasvi💩: im saying so far this is the only project idea we had
10/09/20, 1:26 am - mehul mathur: theres 4 days
10/09/20, 1:26 am - Manasvi💩: yeah ik so we should also try to think of other ideas
10/09/20, 1:27 am - mehul mathur: 4 is a small number i meant
10/09/20, 1:29 am - Manasvi💩: can i say the dbms software idea also?
10/09/20, 1:29 am - Manasvi💩: wont get mad at me na lol
10/09/20, 1:29 am - Manasvi💩: im just throwing out ideas
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: A terminal session means like the whole time right
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: Like if i compile the first time and run
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: History saves 20 commands
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: And then i close terminal
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Manasvi💩: yes
10/09/20, 2:12 am - Pooja: Run again same commands are still there
10/09/20, 2:12 am - mehul mathur: Then those 20 remaon
10/09/20, 2:12 am - mehul mathur: Yeah
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Pooja: will there ever be less than 20 once you reach 20
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Manasvi💩: tahts why make a file
10/09/20, 2:13 am - mehul mathur: And if 21st comes you delete 1st and put new one
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Pooja: Yeah file ik
10/09/20, 2:13 am - mehul mathur: Nah
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Pooja: but like this file will be constant
10/09/20, 2:13 am - mehul mathur: Ya it will
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Pooja: once you run the first time right
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Manasvi💩: yes
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Pooja: Ok cool ty
10/09/20, 2:13 am - Manasvi💩: yes

11/09/20, 12:30 pm - mehul mathur: this took so longgg
11/09/20, 10:56 pm - Pooja: Done already??
11/09/20, 10:56 pm - mehul mathur: No this was rough answers
11/09/20, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: Don't know if correct
11/09/20, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: Only section 1
11/09/20, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: We'll go over them today afternoon
11/09/20, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: Let's do it right after classes na tho
11/09/20, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: What tuts we have?
11/09/20, 11:07 pm - Pooja: bro lets do a search engine
11/09/20, 11:07 pm - Pooja: For algo project
11/09/20, 11:07 pm - Manasvi💩: nice
11/09/20, 11:08 pm - mehul mathur: Search engine ?
11/09/20, 11:08 pm - mehul mathur: Like google
11/09/20, 11:08 pm - mehul mathur: ?
11/09/20, 11:08 pm - mehul mathur: Wait did you guys see thism
11/09/20, 11:09 pm - mehul mathur: These are specifically analysia
11/09/20, 11:09 pm - Manasvi💩: search engine is kinda massiv tho
11/09/20, 11:09 pm - Manasvi💩: massive*
11/09/20, 11:10 pm - mehul mathur: Wait pooja egsplain
11/09/20, 11:10 pm - Pooja: We can do a smaller version
11/09/20, 11:10 pm - mehul mathur: Wait so like proper search engine?
11/09/20, 11:10 pm - Manasvi💩: uhhuh
11/09/20, 11:10 pm - mehul mathur: Like it searches over the internet?
11/09/20, 11:17 pm - Manasvi💩: although pooja i think therell be a lot f caching and shit involved
11/09/20, 11:19 pm - Pooja: Caching?
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: Ok so we know tries are the most optimal
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: Maybe we can go implement it with different algos
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - mehul mathur: Tries?
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - mehul mathur: For search engine
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Manasvi💩: no but  if i search something up
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Manasvi💩: server stores it
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - mehul mathur: I thought edit distance
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: Show that look how much time this take and looks how wl tries works
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Manasvi💩: in the cache
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: so?
11/09/20, 11:20 pm - mehul mathur: Arey that's if we actually care about loading the pages they search
11/09/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: Our convern is just search engine
11/09/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: Not how fast the websites load
11/09/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: https://www.toptal.com/algorithms/needle-in-a-haystack-a-nifty-large-scale-text-search-algorithm
11/09/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: Pooja you looked at that pdf?
11/09/20, 11:22 pm - Pooja: no
11/09/20, 11:22 pm - mehul mathur: See it no
11/09/20, 11:24 pm - Manasvi💩: search engine is bigger than this
11/09/20, 11:24 pm - Pooja: theyre good but they feel like an assignment
11/09/20, 11:24 pm - Manasvi💩: this is just looking through text i already have with me
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - Pooja: yeah
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - Pooja: thats good na
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - Pooja: bc just implementing a trie isnt enough
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - Pooja: ?
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - mehul mathur: What else?
11/09/20, 11:25 pm - mehul mathur: We could also try edit distance
11/09/20, 11:26 pm - Pooja: so i thought we could use different algos
11/09/20, 11:26 pm - Pooja: to implement same thing and compare
11/09/20, 11:26 pm - mehul mathur: Ok but we already know
11/09/20, 11:26 pm - mehul mathur: Tries and edit ka complexity
11/09/20, 11:27 pm - mehul mathur: It's very trivial
11/09/20, 11:27 pm - mehul mathur: Ya ya I'm not saying take them as it is
11/09/20, 11:27 pm - Manasvi💩: yeah
11/09/20, 11:27 pm - Pooja: see every algo we either know
11/09/20, 11:27 pm - Pooja: or we dont
11/09/20, 11:28 pm - Pooja: if you want to work with algos we don't know
11/09/20, 11:28 pm - Pooja: then we have to figure out what they are
11/09/20, 11:28 pm - mehul mathur: Point is in the pdf they have very strange and doubtful algos whose proofs are not clear and they want us to explore thsg
11/09/20, 11:28 pm - Pooja: and start there
11/09/20, 11:28 pm - mehul mathur: That is good
11/09/20, 11:33 pm - Pooja: svi
11/09/20, 11:33 pm - Pooja: do you know how badly we did on DNA quiz
11/09/20, 11:33 pm - Pooja: negative marks bro
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Manasvi💩: what?
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Manasvi💩: key came?
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: Those two questions you mustve got wrong na
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: Key constraint is wala
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: And that other one
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - mehul mathur: Where the answer is others
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Manasvi💩: broooo
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: what the fuck does mean mean
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: does it mean implies
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Pooja: or definition
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Manasvi💩: everything is none
11/09/20, 11:34 pm - Manasvi💩: wtffff
11/09/20, 11:35 pm - Pooja: thats too ambiguous
11/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: baaahh
11/09/20, 11:35 pm - Manasvi💩: shit dude
11/09/20, 11:35 pm - mehul mathur: That's what we thought we were like not so many can be none so we thought questions were wrong
11/09/20, 11:35 pm - mehul mathur: Never think that
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - Manasvi💩: fuck dude
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: no the questions were not worded well
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: "mean" is not clear
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - mehul mathur: Veryy bad
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - Pooja: you can argue both sides
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - mehul mathur: Which one you saying?
11/09/20, 11:36 pm - Manasvi💩: all of them
11/09/20, 11:37 pm - Manasvi💩: all of them had what does this 'mean'
11/09/20, 11:37 pm - mehul mathur: Yeah and all options were not what they meant but random truth statements so we thought they worded wrong and prolly just want which is correct
11/09/20, 11:37 pm - mehul mathur: But like it literally meant what do they mean
11/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: But lite small percentage quiz
11/09/20, 11:39 pm - mehul mathur: Project is wjere they grade
11/09/20, 11:59 pm - mehul mathur: See he needs these weird algos and ideas and wants us to explore that
11/09/20, 11:59 pm - mehul mathur: Like specific is good
12/09/20, 12:01 am - Pooja: kya specific bro
12/09/20, 12:02 am - Pooja: everything hes saying is so
12/09/20, 12:02 am - Pooja: general
12/09/20, 12:02 am - mehul mathur: Ok yeah yeah nvm
12/09/20, 12:02 am - Pooja: it seems like aakashs religion idea wouldve actually worked now

12/09/20, 2:53 am - Pooja: wtf
12/09/20, 2:54 am - Manasvi💩: after a year
12/09/20, 2:54 am - mehul mathur: Both of you sick smh
12/09/20, 2:54 am - mehul mathur: Ok since both me and pooja did section 1
12/09/20, 2:55 am - mehul mathur: Manasvi you read a lil chapter 8
12/09/20, 2:55 am - Pooja: read slides
12/09/20, 2:55 am - mehul mathur: And then we'll decide what to keep
12/09/20, 2:55 am - Manasvi💩: eh whennnn

13/09/20, 6:49 am - mehul mathur: Bro she's gonna be done with you by the end of DA 😂
13/09/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: Ask her what is symbol for natural join and do column names have to be same for nat join to make sense
13/09/20, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: And if they don't then which name comes in the common one
13/09/20, 7:04 am - Pooja: the first one you join comes
13/09/20, 7:04 am - Pooja: ik symbol for nat join is *
13/09/20, 7:04 am - Pooja: But in this assignment would they prefer us to not use it so we re 100% saying what exactly we re joining the tables with
13/09/20, 7:05 am - mehul mathur: Would they matlab?
13/09/20, 7:05 am - mehul mathur: Mallika didn't reply yet?
13/09/20, 7:10 am - mehul mathur: Hailo?
13/09/20, 7:11 am - mehul mathur: But replacing natural join with equijoin and then projecting all of them is too much na
13/09/20, 7:19 am - Pooja: No just leave the table with the extra column
13/09/20, 7:19 am - Pooja: Lets see
13/09/20, 7:19 am - Pooja: She hasnt replied yet
13/09/20, 7:19 am - mehul mathur: Arey thats wrong
13/09/20, 7:22 am - Pooja: redundant yeah
13/09/20, 7:22 am - Pooja: But youre clearly emphasizing what youre joining
13/09/20, 7:22 am - Pooja: All the relations they gave in section 2 they described with equijoin
13/09/20, 7:24 am - mehul mathur: arey yeah but the projected only one of them
13/09/20, 7:24 am - mehul mathur: we have some where we leave our final answer with duplicate columns
13/09/20, 7:24 am - mehul mathur: so should i just change all natural to equijoin and project everything manually?
13/09/20, 7:25 am - Pooja: wait daaaaaaaa
13/09/20, 7:25 am - Pooja: let her reply no
13/09/20, 7:25 am - mehul mathur: areyey

17/09/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: request timed out right
17/09/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: So it took to long
17/09/20, 1:55 pm - mehul mathur: Ya
17/09/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: Thats why now we re trying out with dns servers

17/09/20, 1:56 pm - Pooja: Yep
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: But how does this mean it works?
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: If I switch back to wifi now?
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: Wdym
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: Once you download the mysql image
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: Itll be there on your local machine
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: So dont gotta worry about it
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: I mean if I go to wifi now
17/09/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: And donsame hello world
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: What'll happen?
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: theres a cache
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: chrome has
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: so itll load
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: if you erase cache
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: probably wont work
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: So whenever I wanna do something on docker I have to switch to data?
17/09/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: no da docker was only to get mysql for you
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - Pooja: once you get mysql you wont need connection right
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - mehul mathur: Ya I meant
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - mehul mathur: In future
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - Pooja: but ya if you use docker to get other stuff
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - Pooja: you need fast network
17/09/20, 1:59 pm - mehul mathur: So you changed dns server so what does that mean

29/09/20, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: Called contact info
29/09/20, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: It's also composite
29/09/20, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: Like it has contact number and email
29/09/20, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: And we literally didn't do anything in it
29/09/20, 3:10 am - mehul mathur: We kept it as contact info thru all normal forms
29/09/20, 3:10 am - mehul mathur: We'll have to write that in phase 4 dic

29/09/20, 4:46 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
29/09/20, 4:46 am - mehul mathur: use the second one
29/09/20, 5:15 am - Pooja: My overkill shuts my machine downwnn😂😂😂
29/09/20, 5:15 am - Pooja: Doesnt even make sense its not a command only
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: No bro if you do kill -1
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: That's the default to shutdown every process
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: Like every process
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: So be careful with that
29/09/20, 5:16 am - Pooja: i didnt tho
29/09/20, 5:16 am - Pooja: Im passing kill(pid,sig)
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: Try printing what is being sent to kill
29/09/20, 5:16 am - mehul mathur: If pid is -1 then all processes gone
29/09/20, 5:17 am - Pooja: sometimes it does that sometimes not
29/09/20, 5:17 am - mehul mathur: Ya so prolly sometimes pid becomes -1
29/09/20, 5:17 am - mehul mathur: Print and check
29/09/20, 5:17 am - Pooja: ok lemme see
29/09/20, 5:17 am - mehul mathur: Yaya
29/09/20, 5:30 am - Pooja: So after i run overkill
29/09/20, 5:30 am - Pooja: If i had 4 jobs
29/09/20, 5:30 am - Pooja: 3 immediately output that they exited abnormally
29/09/20, 5:30 am - Pooja: But one takes like 3 seconds
29/09/20, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: No matter what it is?
29/09/20, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Explain how you doing it
29/09/20, 5:52 am - Pooja: no its random sometimes it works properly
29/09/20, 5:52 am - Pooja: Sometimes this problem comes
29/09/20, 5:52 am - Pooja: i have a global var that tracks job number
29/09/20, 5:52 am - Pooja: So i run through that see if its valid atm
29/09/20, 5:53 am - Pooja: If it is i get the corresponding pid and then kill that pid
29/09/20, 5:53 am - Pooja: And then go to next global var
29/09/20, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: Ya so maybe in this part pid is coming as negative?
29/09/20, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: Where do you initialize it ?
29/09/20, 5:56 am - Pooja: If its neg than i skip that one
29/09/20, 5:56 am - Pooja: initialise what?
29/09/20, 5:56 am - Pooja: It works but it just prints like 3 sec later ig
29/09/20, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: A processes pid in that struct when it's created
29/09/20, 5:56 am - Pooja: when i create the background job
29/09/20, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: That's really random
29/09/20, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: It's getting stuck then
29/09/20, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: Show code?
29/09/20, 5:57 am - Pooja: yeah in an hour?
29/09/20, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: Oh ok

01/10/20, 12:55 am - Pooja: Have you seen method of transform in a textbook
01/10/20, 12:55 am - Pooja: I cant find it
01/10/20, 12:58 am - mehul mathur: no cant see it
01/10/20, 12:58 am - mehul mathur: where to study for assignment?
01/10/20, 12:59 am - Pooja: Tb ig
01/10/20, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: i mean
01/10/20, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: ya ok
01/10/20, 1:20 am - Pooja: Ay he just meant wrt to r
01/10/20, 1:20 am - Pooja: Like you can write vol as r^3
01/10/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: no bro
01/10/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: he said
01/10/20, 1:21 am - mehul mathur: dr is small volume element
01/10/20, 1:24 am - Pooja: he talks too fast for him only to keep up
01/10/20, 1:25 am - mehul mathur: ya but dr as vol is stioopid
01/10/20, 1:26 am - Pooja: thats not what he meant
01/10/20, 1:26 am - Pooja: bro see who can understand that graph
01/10/20, 1:26 am - Pooja: Its 1 cm wide
01/10/20, 1:26 am - mehul mathur: so it should be (dr)^3
01/10/20, 1:33 am - Pooja: He wrote density as a function of r tho
01/10/20, 1:33 am - Pooja: Thats why just dr
01/10/20, 1:33 am - mehul mathur: thats what even more confusing
01/10/20, 1:33 am - mehul mathur: density as a function of r looks like its a func of length
01/10/20, 1:34 am - Pooja: arey just p = m/r^3
01/10/20, 1:35 am - mehul mathur: ya so there r meant length
01/10/20, 1:35 am - mehul mathur: but dr means volume
01/10/20, 1:35 am - mehul mathur: what
01/10/20, 1:36 am - Pooja: arey he said by accident
01/10/20, 1:36 am - mehul mathur: unacceptable
01/10/20, 1:37 am - Pooja: forgive him
01/10/20, 1:37 am - mehul mathur: first what is this sanchits problem

01/10/20, 1:47 am - mehul mathur: no chemistry noo
01/10/20, 1:48 am - Pooja: We spent like a month on mechanics so far lmao
01/10/20, 1:49 am - mehul mathur: ya we wont have time
01/10/20, 1:54 am - Pooja: Weird beeping sound?
01/10/20, 1:57 am - mehul mathur: his phone
01/10/20, 1:59 am - Pooja: Not the notif da
01/10/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: arey it was ringing
01/10/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: so when phone rings near computer
01/10/20, 2:01 am - mehul mathur: that happens
01/10/20, 2:02 am - Pooja: oh never knew that
01/10/20, 2:03 am - mehul mathur: you are welcome
01/10/20, 2:55 am - mehul mathur: ok found another mistake
01/10/20, 2:55 am - mehul mathur: we have to keep foreign key in room only not in guest
01/10/20, 2:55 am - mehul mathur: cuz in guest reserves room (1:N) room is on the N side
01/10/20, 2:56 am - mehul mathur: and that means ROOM tables will have lots of null values for unavailable rooms
01/10/20, 2:58 am - mehul mathur: so ill create a new table called ROOM_BOOKING
01/10/20, 3:11 am - Pooja: so first time right onl7
01/10/20, 3:11 am - mehul mathur: no
01/10/20, 3:11 am - mehul mathur: im creating a new table
01/10/20, 3:11 am - mehul mathur: first time what we did was room had foreign key to guest
01/10/20, 3:12 am - mehul mathur: that means all unbooked rooms have that as NULL
01/10/20, 3:15 am - mehul mathur: ok i changed in creatle
01/10/20, 3:15 am - mehul mathur: holy shit we made a lotta changes
01/10/20, 3:34 am - Pooja: oh okok
01/10/20, 3:34 am - Pooja: Wont it be fine though

01/10/20, 8:12 am - mehul mathur: where the columns are
01/10/20, 8:13 am - mehul mathur: checkin date , checkout date , duration
01/10/20, 8:13 am - mehul mathur: now what the actual fuck

01/10/20, 8:26 am - Pooja: No dude
01/10/20, 8:26 am - Pooja: We had it for a reason
01/10/20, 8:26 am - Pooja: can you chill
01/10/20, 8:26 am - Pooja: We made this a week ago
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Ya
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Bro
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: It violates 3nf if we put it in ghest
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Guest
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: Non prime to non prime
01/10/20, 8:27 am - Pooja: So we made table
01/10/20, 8:28 am - mehul mathur: bro tell me this
01/10/20, 8:28 am - mehul mathur: what is that table for exactly?
01/10/20, 8:28 am - mehul mathur: like what goes in it?
01/10/20, 8:28 am - Pooja: See how long a guest stays
01/10/20, 8:28 am - Pooja: Thats important info whatre you saying
01/10/20, 8:28 am - mehul mathur: which guest?
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: theres no foreign key from that table to anyother
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: Theres no guest id attribute?
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: nope
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: Ok guess we forgot add
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: in creately
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: thats not how 3nf decompostion woks
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: eorks
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: no we dont add
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: yeah it is
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: no
01/10/20, 8:29 am - Pooja: We need that table
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: checkin , checkout --> duration
01/10/20, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: was the fd that was violating 3nf right
01/10/20, 8:30 am - Pooja: Yes
01/10/20, 8:30 am - mehul mathur: so what 3nf will do is make a separate table of just checkin , checkout , duration
01/10/20, 8:30 am - mehul mathur: and now this table just means duration = checkout - checkin
01/10/20, 8:30 am - mehul mathur: so its useless
01/10/20, 8:30 am - Pooja: bro
01/10/20, 8:30 am - Pooja: Big deal
01/10/20, 8:30 am - mehul mathur: are you not getting it?
01/10/20, 8:30 am - Pooja: So we ll make a table where there are 3 primary keys
01/10/20, 8:31 am - mehul mathur: so what i add all 365C2 combinations of dates in it?
01/10/20, 8:31 am - Pooja: Booking id checkin checkout
01/10/20, 8:31 am - Pooja: can you chill man
01/10/20, 8:31 am - mehul mathur: or i could do
01/10/20, 8:31 am - mehul mathur: make the checkin checkout a foreign key
01/10/20, 8:31 am - mehul mathur: to the checkin checkout in GUEST
01/10/20, 8:31 am - mehul mathur: ya ok ill do that
01/10/20, 8:32 am - Pooja: checkin checkout is not a key
01/10/20, 8:32 am - Pooja: it can be repeated
01/10/20, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: bro it is
01/10/20, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: oh yeah
01/10/20, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: so ill have to add then
01/10/20, 8:32 am - Pooja: Just do this
01/10/20, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: a booking id

01/10/20, 8:32 am - Pooja: yeah
01/10/20, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: or icould just get rid of it
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: No its important
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: cuz why do we need a table that tells me what checkout - cehckin is?
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: What hotel doesnt know how long a guest is there
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: i can do that by myself
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: We need to know when a guest is arriving and leaving
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: hotel can do subtraction
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: abeyyy
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: Everytime you want a user to use
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: checkin checkout date is there in GUEST
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: You want them to subtract in their heads uh
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: It makes sense
01/10/20, 8:33 am - mehul mathur: only duration ke liye we made 3nf
01/10/20, 8:33 am - Pooja: I dont understand why you have such an issue with adding it😂😂
01/10/20, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: cuz in 3nf
01/10/20, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: you shouldnt have to add it
01/10/20, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: i mean ok ill add it
01/10/20, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: also in FLOOR_SUP im making SUP_SSN a foreign key to SSN in maid service
01/10/20, 8:36 am - mehul mathur: ok but now in booking id , checkin , checkout , duration
01/10/20, 8:36 am - mehul mathur: what is the key?
01/10/20, 8:36 am - mehul mathur: booking id
01/10/20, 8:38 am - Pooja: Yeah but for database sake we need it
01/10/20, 8:39 am - Pooja: no da if thats the key then same 3nf problem
01/10/20, 8:39 am - Pooja: Make booking id checkin check out key

01/10/20, 8:40 am - mehul mathur: whyyy
01/10/20, 8:40 am - Pooja: just bc we dont know how to do it doesnt mean we chuck
01/10/20, 8:41 am - mehul mathur: why do we need table which is like , look - subtraction
01/10/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: Irl
01/10/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: If someone made some df database which didnt have this
01/10/20, 8:41 am - mehul mathur: the only correct solution to this is
01/10/20, 8:41 am - Pooja: Itd be retarded
01/10/20, 8:41 am - mehul mathur: i do all 365C2
01/10/20, 8:41 am - mehul mathur: combinations
01/10/20, 8:41 am - mehul mathur: like thats the one that keeps all 3nf and all intact
01/10/20, 8:42 am - Pooja: No da
01/10/20, 8:43 am - Pooja: According to me
01/10/20, 8:43 am - Pooja: In our database that table should only have check in checkout of currently residing guests
01/10/20, 8:43 am - mehul mathur: bro i dont think you unserstand why 3nf does what it does
01/10/20, 8:43 am - Pooja: which we dont know how to do
01/10/20, 8:43 am - mehul mathur: there is no way to do it
01/10/20, 8:44 am - mehul mathur: cant make checkin checkout key
01/10/20, 8:44 am - Pooja: so youre saying
01/10/20, 8:44 am - Pooja: In real life
01/10/20, 8:44 am - mehul mathur: and cant add booking id key
01/10/20, 8:44 am - Pooja: This is not a feature of a database
01/10/20, 8:44 am - mehul mathur: i mean theyll have checkin and chcekout only
01/10/20, 8:44 am - mehul mathur: and if they wanna see duration
01/10/20, 8:44 am - mehul mathur: they just query it out
01/10/20, 8:45 am - mehul mathur: like select checkout checkin
01/10/20, 8:45 am - Pooja: 😬
01/10/20, 8:45 am - mehul mathur: checkout - checkin
01/10/20, 8:45 am - mehul mathur: ya
01/10/20, 8:45 am - Pooja: maybe we can do that yeah
01/10/20, 8:45 am - mehul mathur: so that means no duration column
01/10/20, 8:46 am - mehul mathur: did the phase 1 reqs say we needed atleast one derived
01/10/20, 8:46 am - Pooja: Yes

02/10/20, 12:06 am - mehul mathur: so obv how can we tell how much space the other  guy will need for his code and all
02/10/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: even git cant handle 3 people editing same fie
02/10/20, 12:07 am - mehul mathur: file

02/10/20, 4:06 am - Pooja: ok ya peace
02/10/20, 4:06 am - Pooja: Phew
02/10/20, 4:06 am - mehul mathur: ha
02/10/20, 4:06 am - mehul mathur: bro these queries are a pain
02/10/20, 4:07 am - mehul mathur: how is group assignment going?
02/10/20, 4:07 am - Pooja: finished first question
02/10/20, 4:07 am - mehul mathur: like whole first section?
02/10/20, 4:07 am - Pooja: ya
02/10/20, 4:07 am - mehul mathur: ayy
02/10/20, 4:07 am - mehul mathur: i think you need view and stufzz for section 2
02/10/20, 4:08 am - Pooja: didnt read that yet
02/10/20, 4:08 am - mehul mathur: i didnt start anything in python only spent this much time in some changes
02/10/20, 4:08 am - mehul mathur: so i added on delete cascade constraints everywhere
02/10/20, 4:17 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
02/10/20, 4:17 am - mehul mathur: heres the file now with those on delete constraints
02/10/20, 4:17 am - mehul mathur: and i added my queries in the phase 4 doc look at them
02/10/20, 4:17 am - mehul mathur: ill start python stuff in a bit
02/10/20, 4:20 am - Pooja: what delete constraints?
02/10/20, 4:20 am - Pooja: Wfym
02/10/20, 4:20 am - Pooja: Wdym
02/10/20, 4:34 am - mehul mathur: Uh so
02/10/20, 4:34 am - mehul mathur: For example of trip booking has a foreign key to guest id 2 which booked it
02/10/20, 4:34 am - mehul mathur: Then deleting that guest will delete this row from trip booking also
02/10/20, 4:35 am - mehul mathur: Basically if the parent row is deleted all its child rows are too
02/10/20, 4:35 am - Manasvi💩: wait thats part of the query na?
02/10/20, 4:36 am - Manasvi💩: shouldnt you do that in the function of that python script
02/10/20, 4:37 am - mehul mathur: Nope
02/10/20, 4:37 am - mehul mathur: It's a db feature bro
02/10/20, 4:37 am - mehul mathur: On delete and on update conatraints
02/10/20, 4:42 am - Pooja: No but while executing the query
02/10/20, 4:42 am - Pooja: We ll run those functions right
02/10/20, 4:42 am - Pooja: To delete or whatever
02/10/20, 4:43 am - Pooja: And we ll take care of all cases
02/10/20, 4:43 am - Pooja: In python only?
02/10/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: Arey no bro
02/10/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: Listen
02/10/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: Theres a room_booked table
02/10/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: In it let's say the guest id and room he booked is 2, 101
02/10/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: Now from the guest table
02/10/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: If I delet guest 2
02/10/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: This should obviously go too
02/10/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: Like no need
02/10/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: So database does that on its own now
02/10/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: Just source this
02/10/20, 6:35 am - Pooja: any doubts lol
02/10/20, 6:35 am - mehul mathur: nope

05/10/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: Use the ROTATE table to rotate all the points in POINTS anticlockwise by alpha! (Hint: You can write
three separate queries for updating the X, Y, Z coordinates of the points in POINTS. However, do not
write queries for each point)

06/10/20, 1:42 am - Pooja: After update
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: arey this command doesnt work
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: the update maps onto point table
06/10/20, 1:42 am - Pooja: X join that you created
06/10/20, 1:42 am - Pooja: Has columns col1 col2 col2 and x y z
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: ya
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: usme i update only x or y or z
06/10/20, 1:42 am - Pooja: Update changes that table only
06/10/20, 1:42 am - Pooja: To diff values of x
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: and that maps to point
06/10/20, 1:42 am - mehul mathur: its a view
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: wdym maps to a point
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: Arey
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: View is a temp table
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: Same thig
06/10/20, 1:43 am - mehul mathur: so it maps to the table it was created from also
06/10/20, 1:43 am - mehul mathur: *******************
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: Does update do that
06/10/20, 1:43 am - mehul mathur: because this X_JOIN was created using POINT
06/10/20, 1:43 am - Pooja: Does it not just change value
06/10/20, 1:43 am - mehul mathur: an update to it
06/10/20, 1:43 am - mehul mathur: updated POINT
06/10/20, 1:44 am - mehul mathur: thats what update is yes
06/10/20, 1:44 am - Pooja: Youre saying point table changes
06/10/20, 1:44 am - Pooja: ?
06/10/20, 1:44 am - Pooja: I dont get how
06/10/20, 1:44 am - mehul mathur: cuz view ke updates change in its parent table also

A command line interface that accesses a mysql database named 'HOTEL_QUOKKA'.
- The contents of the Database HOTEL_QUOKKA are dumped and saved in newt.sql file with some test values in the tables. To start a mysql environment with that database run the command:
```sh
mysql -u <username> -p 
```
- And then source the file inside the mysql environment by:
```sh
source newt.sql
```

 - Exit mysql environment and download the python file HotelQuokka.py. Run it as
 ```sh
 python3 HotelQuokka.py
 ```
This will lead you to a CLI interface, where on entering your username and mysql password, you can begin to interact with the Database.

12/10/20, 3:47 am - Pooja: what
12/10/20, 3:47 am - mehul mathur: any student with a slot will only start vaccinating once all k slots are filled
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: otherwise no
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: idk if we already did that or not
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: what we did was
12/10/20, 3:48 am - Pooja: thats what you told me in the morning
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: nono
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: what we did was
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: once a student finds a slot
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: hell just start
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: taking tests and all
12/10/20, 3:48 am - mehul mathur: but he has to wait until other seats are filled
12/10/20, 3:48 am - Pooja: Thats what manvith said in clarification too
12/10/20, 3:49 am - mehul mathur: yeah i mean i though just that the zone allocates the next k slots only once these are filled
12/10/20, 3:49 am - mehul mathur: not that the students sitting there also have to wait
12/10/20, 1:22 pm - Pooja: Mehul you free
12/10/20, 1:22 pm - Pooja: I need help with my q2 code
12/10/20, 1:46 pm - mehul mathur: You up now
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - Pooja: Yup yup found bugg
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - mehul mathur: Nicecoc
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - mehul mathur: What was it
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - mehul mathur: Did you do it with the thing fixed?
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - Pooja: wdym fixed
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - mehul mathur: Like zone can't start vaccinating anyone until slots are filled
12/10/20, 1:51 pm - mehul mathur: That manvith thing
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: We haven't found anything for that yey
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: Yet
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - Pooja: Yeah i recoded whole thing
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - Pooja: Wdym
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: Arey
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: I mean if a student gets a slot
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: He'll start vaccinating right away?
12/10/20, 1:52 pm - Pooja: No i wdym you havent found
12/10/20, 1:53 pm - Pooja: No i did like all slots will be filled
12/10/20, 1:53 pm - Pooja: Then all students get vaccinated together
12/10/20, 1:53 pm - mehul mathur: Ok what if 3 students left but 5 slots
12/10/20, 1:53 pm - mehul mathur: We didn't do it like that na we did student starts getting vaccination as soon as he finds a seat
12/10/20, 1:53 pm - Pooja: idk what you did
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: This
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - Pooja: That wont be a case
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: Ofc it will
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - Pooja: bc like i slot only according to who is at the gate at the moment
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: If there are 5 students
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: 2 zones
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: With 5 slots
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: Each
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: And one takes 2
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: Other takes 3
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - Pooja: noo the slotting process only
12/10/20, 1:54 pm - mehul mathur: Then?
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: I have this mutex for students at gate
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: so like it slots one by one
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: So if one zone takes 5 slots
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: The other zone will get none
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - mehul mathur: Oh what
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - Pooja: Hmm but its given a zone should have at least one slot
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - mehul mathur: No bro
12/10/20, 1:55 pm - mehul mathur: Yeah I mean
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - mehul mathur: Giving slots should be concurrent
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - mehul mathur: Not one by one
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - Pooja: This is concurrent only
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - Pooja: Im just locking student
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - mehul mathur: Both zones should be able to take students
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - mehul mathur: You can't do like one will take 5 and other wont
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - Pooja: why not tho
12/10/20, 1:56 pm - mehul mathur: You're stopping that zone from functioning while other takes
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: yeah it cant take at the same time right
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: bc the number of students at the gaye
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: Is some value that if two threads access same time
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - Pooja: Itll get messed up
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: I mean that's what you have to synchronize
12/10/20, 1:57 pm - mehul mathur: But you don't compromise the zone working
12/10/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: Ok ill just give it one
12/10/20, 1:58 pm - Pooja: And have nobody come there
12/10/20, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: I think theres a generic way
12/10/20, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: Like not a jugaad way
12/10/20, 2:06 pm - Pooja: Bro but see what aakash said in that bro fugoll
12/10/20, 2:06 pm - Pooja: If zone capacity isnt full
12/10/20, 2:06 pm - Pooja: Dont vaccinate
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - Pooja: So you have to make sure zone capacity makes sense to number of students at gate
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: Ya but what you're doing is stopping other zones
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: Ok listen
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: 5 students
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: 2 zones
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - Pooja: im not stopping im running one by one
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: Each with 5 slots
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: 2 in one
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - Pooja: Same as locking in other plafes
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - Pooja: Places
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: 3 in another
12/10/20, 2:07 pm - mehul mathur: Now what happens tell
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - Pooja: Thats what im saying this case is not valid
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - Pooja: If it was than students in those zones wont ever get vaccinated only
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - mehul mathur: Abeyyyy
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - mehul mathur: That was the sanchit Arora doubt
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - mehul mathur: And manvith said
12/10/20, 2:08 pm - mehul mathur: It can be very much a possibility
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: And you have to handle it
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: ok yeah
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: Like somehow
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: Then its better no
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: You have to tell the zone
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: Oh
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: Youll never fill
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: So stary
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: Start
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: Just check number of students at gaye
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: Gate
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: at each moment
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: This will be constant bro
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: Dont even have to lock noe
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: Like the example I gave
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - Pooja: Decrease it then no -_-
12/10/20, 2:09 pm - mehul mathur: It'll always be 5
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - mehul mathur: Abey we tried fixing today
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: no once you assign a student to a zone
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: Decrease
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: Do you have a gate variable
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - mehul mathur: It only decreases when he gets vaccinated
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - mehul mathur: Not when slot is assigned
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: I have a gate variable
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: So i decrease that
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: Not total student variable
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - mehul mathur: You mean number of students only na
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - mehul mathur: Oh
12/10/20, 2:10 pm - Pooja: No
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - mehul mathur: What's the difference?
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - Pooja: If a student is waiting
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - Pooja: That i put as some student at gate variable
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - Pooja: And total students in process
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - Pooja: I put as student track variable
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - mehul mathur: Wait gate <= students na?
12/10/20, 2:11 pm - Pooja: Yeah
12/10/20, 2:12 pm - mehul mathur: So you'll have to say if gate variable becomes zero
12/10/20, 2:12 pm - mehul mathur: Then break or something
12/10/20, 2:12 pm - mehul mathur: But see gate variable keeps changing na pooja
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: Like if the other zone has some
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: And this zone has some
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: And gate var is 0 now yeaj
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: So you'll say
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: Oh
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: Break it
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: Like sorry
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: You'll say
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: Start vaccinating
12/10/20, 2:13 pm - mehul mathur: But what if those students fail test and back at the gate
12/10/20, 2:14 pm - mehul mathur: Then you shouldn't have started
12/10/20, 2:14 pm - mehul mathur: Could have waited for them
12/10/20, 2:14 pm - mehul mathur: Do you get it?
12/10/20, 2:21 pm - Pooja: No theres no could have waited
12/10/20, 2:21 pm - Pooja: Manviths clarification says at the current time if nobodys at the gate then vaccinate
12/10/20, 2:22 pm - Pooja: so you cant start
12/10/20, 2:22 pm - Pooja: It works

12/11/20, 4:43 am - Manasvi💩: os uh?
12/11/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: ya
12/11/20, 4:43 am - mehul mathur: her recv doesnt wanna block only
12/11/20, 4:43 am - Manasvi💩: use write
12/11/20, 4:44 am - Manasvi💩: read
12/11/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: arey read and recv same hai bey
12/11/20, 4:44 am - mehul mathur: recv with 0 flags is read
12/11/20, 4:58 am - Pooja: let me try actually
12/11/20, 4:58 am - Pooja: with read and write
12/11/20, 4:59 am - Pooja: maybeee
12/11/20, 4:59 am - mehul mathur: ya try
12/11/20, 4:59 am - mehul mathur: why the hell he not replying tho
12/11/20, 4:59 am - mehul mathur: what a shitty teeya
12/11/20, 6:47 am - Pooja: He replied at 4 40
12/11/20, 6:47 am - Pooja: And i didnt see 😬
12/11/20, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: areyy fukk
12/11/20, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: recode bro
12/11/20, 12:40 pm - Pooja: You know the scariest part of that form
12/11/20, 12:41 pm - Pooja: Realizing our whole college has only 1k students in it wtff
12/11/20, 12:49 pm - mehul mathur: smol college
12/11/20, 12:50 pm - mehul mathur: also yeah
12/11/20, 12:50 pm - mehul mathur: but thats not scary
12/11/20, 12:50 pm - mehul mathur: makes you feel like the top 1%
12/11/20, 12:53 pm - Pooja: I hate it :(
12/11/20, 12:53 pm - mehul mathur: oh
12/11/20, 12:54 pm - mehul mathur: arey but bigass colleges me you only know your subject wale people
12/11/20, 12:54 pm - mehul mathur: here you know so many people
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - Pooja: It worked 😭😭😭😭😭
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - Pooja: My dad told bro ahahahahhh
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - mehul mathur: Wtff
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - mehul mathur: Your dad helps you in assignment codes that's awesome
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - mehul mathur: What was the mistake.
12/11/20, 11:06 pm - mehul mathur: ?
12/11/20, 11:15 pm - Pooja: yeah just this one
12/11/20, 11:15 pm - Pooja: the number of bytes sending and receiving wasnt matching up properly
12/11/20, 11:16 pm - mehul mathur: oh
12/11/20, 11:16 pm - mehul mathur: but why
12/11/20, 11:16 pm - mehul mathur: that we saw already na
12/11/20, 11:18 pm - Pooja: no we didnt
12/11/20, 11:19 pm - mehul mathur: yes we did we saw that read was recieving like 50 bytes but send was sending like 17 bytes
12/11/20, 11:19 pm - Pooja: yeah thats the issue
12/11/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: they have to both send 50 and receive 50
12/11/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: or itll stack overrun and buffer will go into stack
12/11/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: ok so for the big cases
12/11/20, 11:20 pm - Pooja: while recv parts of the file you recv it in a loop right
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: till it recv all the bytes that were being sent?
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: if you are taking in chunks of like 10^6 yes
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: yeah that only
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: for 1024 it shouldnt matter
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: wait bro so what if you dont wanna send 50
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: this recv wont take from the next send?
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: wont work
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: you should send and receive same number
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: kyaa
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - mehul mathur: so how will you do it
12/11/20, 11:21 pm - Pooja: yeah no makes sense
12/11/20, 11:22 pm - Pooja: we re writing into some string buffer na so what you put in exactly that only you should take out
12/11/20, 11:22 pm - Pooja: just make it char array of size 50 fill with null and your message
12/11/20, 11:22 pm - Pooja: ok waiittt
12/11/20, 11:22 pm - Pooja: tell this
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: no
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: cuz that prev sends bytes are still stuck in the stream
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: so recv will take them
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - Pooja: ok cool cool
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: think all of it as a stream then it makes sense
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - Pooja: and the other side is stuck at a recv also
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - mehul mathur: the server side?
12/11/20, 11:23 pm - Pooja: so it wont send anything more yet
12/11/20, 11:24 pm - Pooja: yeah
12/11/20, 11:24 pm - Pooja: okkkkk peace
12/11/20, 11:24 pm - Pooja: tyty
12/11/20, 11:24 pm - mehul mathur: yeah yeah thats why alternative send recv is best
12/11/20, 11:44 pm - Pooja: Ay bro my comp hangs when i do huge files
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - Pooja: Its stops at like 60% and freezes
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - mehul mathur: ah fuck
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - mehul mathur: how huge
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - mehul mathur: 1.2G?
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - Pooja: Yeah
12/11/20, 11:45 pm - mehul mathur: freezes every single time?
12/11/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: that could be just computer specific
12/11/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: try closing all other tabs and apps
12/11/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: then try
12/11/20, 11:46 pm - mehul mathur: or give me executable
12/11/20, 11:55 pm - Pooja: wait one sec
12/11/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: Why did manasvis hang?
12/11/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: what was the problem there
12/11/20, 11:57 pm - mehul mathur: manasvis didnt hang na
12/11/20, 11:57 pm - mehul mathur: her toh some mistake only was there
12/11/20, 11:57 pm - Pooja: oh it just took too long?
12/11/20, 11:58 pm - mehul mathur: no i mean she said its not working for 10^6 chunk size but ok for 1024
12/11/20, 11:58 pm - mehul mathur: but idts it was hanging
12/11/20, 11:58 pm - mehul mathur: just gimme executable no if it works on mine then its working
12/11/20, 11:59 pm - Pooja: yeah one sec

14/01/21, 9:33 am - Manasvi💩: at me?
14/01/21, 9:33 am - Manasvi💩: or in general
14/01/21, 9:33 am - mehul mathur: In general
14/01/21, 9:33 am - mehul mathur: Ofc at you bro
14/01/21, 9:34 am - mehul mathur: Also how did it get in group chat
14/01/21, 9:34 am - mehul mathur: Lite
14/01/21, 9:52 am - Pooja: lmaoo
14/01/21, 9:52 am - Pooja: is menu different from dropdown guys
14/01/21, 9:54 am - Manasvi💩: for navbar?
14/01/21, 9:54 am - Pooja: no for that choosing recruiter or applicant while logging in
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Manasvi💩: oh dropdown and all lite
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Manasvi💩: just make a select optio for that
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Pooja: i am spending time on dumbfk things
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Manasvi💩: theres a lot to do
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Manasvi💩: i hateetetytasjgfwgejwkghwlgjrewh
14/01/21, 9:55 am - Pooja: yeah
14/01/21, 10:00 am - mehul mathur: Ya but you gotta make it look somewhat decent
25/01/21, 1:41 am - mehul mathur: hello
23/02/21, 12:41 am - mehul mathur: Ok for the selection na
23/02/21, 12:41 am - mehul mathur: Don't do random.choice on the full thing
23/02/21, 12:41 am - mehul mathur: Take like the top 5 best ones
23/02/21, 12:41 am - mehul mathur: And then look at parents only from there
23/02/21, 12:42 am - mehul mathur: Like on the top 5 calc the weights according to scores and then do random.choice
23/02/21, 12:42 am - mehul mathur: Inporves performance a lot
23/02/21, 12:43 am - mehul mathur: Also if you guys are testing out your thing on a fake goal vector then make the fitness score as sum of relative errors
23/02/21, 12:43 am - mehul mathur: You deleted this message
23/02/21, 12:43 am - mehul mathur: (Goal - value )/ goal
23/02/21, 12:44 am - mehul mathur: @917674002626 @919980677602 revive this group
23/02/21, 12:44 am - mehul mathur: Oh wait notifs don't work for pooj
23/02/21, 12:50 am - Pooja: Why 5
23/02/21, 12:51 am - Pooja: Chummam
23/02/21, 12:51 am - Pooja: ?
23/02/21, 12:52 am - Pooja: And what does this mean
23/02/21, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: Matlab like
23/02/21, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: If you are just testing your GA if it works and actually reduces error
23/02/21, 12:59 am - mehul mathur: Then one thing you can do is instead of sending to server for api call
23/02/21, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: Create your one goal vector
23/02/21, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: Own
23/02/21, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: A 11d vector and keep values close-ish to the overfit one
23/02/21, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: And then have your algo try to reach that goal vector
23/02/21, 1:00 am - mehul mathur: Ive been doing that since morning and found out that relative error is best
23/02/21, 1:01 am - mehul mathur: Like if goal is [1,2,3] and a chromosome is [3,4,8]
23/02/21, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: Then err here is abs(1-3)/1 + abs(2-4)/2 + abs(3-8)/4
23/02/21, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: Like that
23/02/21, 1:02 am - mehul mathur: (3-8)/3 aorry
23/02/21, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: Top 7-8 would have not much effect 
Top-3 matlab it would end up in a local optima too quickly maybe
23/02/21, 1:03 am - mehul mathur: So I thought top 5
23/02/21, 1:37 am - mehul mathur: Any of you wanna do that roast thing?
23/02/21, 1:37 am - mehul mathur: For felicity
23/02/21, 2:43 am - Pooja: i will read this later but i am acknowledging it so you dont yell at me for seening
23/02/21, 2:43 am - Pooja: And no
23/02/21, 2:44 am - mehul mathur: Thanks for acknowledging
23/02/21, 2:45 am - Pooja: its ok
23/02/21, 2:45 am - mehul mathur: Ok so in the evening y'all wanna
23/02/21, 2:45 am - mehul mathur: Get together
23/02/21, 2:46 am - Manasvi💩: no
23/02/21, 2:46 am - mehul mathur: My god so many "no"s
23/02/21, 2:46 am - mehul mathur: Cool then
23/02/21, 2:48 am - Pooja: Lmaooo

23/02/21, 2:49 am - mehul mathur: 🤪
24/02/21, 6:41 am - mehul mathur: um did you guys get any new way
24/02/21, 6:41 am - mehul mathur: to reduce the error more
24/02/21, 6:41 am - mehul mathur: in MDL
24/02/21, 7:31 am - Pooja: today was our first good day
24/02/21, 7:31 am - mehul mathur: good as in?
24/02/21, 7:32 am - Pooja: good
24/02/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: abey
24/02/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: like errors were not 10^40 anymore good or
24/02/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: errors are significantly less good
24/02/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: This
24/02/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: wait idk what you mean
24/02/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: We are dumb basically
24/02/21, 7:42 am - mehul mathur: No I mean
24/02/21, 7:42 am - mehul mathur: You wanna discuss?
24/02/21, 7:42 am - mehul mathur: Like how do you guys test any small idea you have
24/02/21, 7:42 am - mehul mathur: Do you test with 10  generations first or get an idea and directly do 45
24/02/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: we ve been doing with 45
24/02/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: But im done with mdl for today bro
24/02/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: What range are you errors looking lile
24/02/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: overfit ka error - 381807316124.88
my thing after 25 generations - 191526736891.17
24/02/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: What power is that
24/02/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: Both are 12 only
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: So like between 1/2 and 1/3 reduction
24/02/21, 7:45 am - Pooja: hmm ok
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Here 
Selection - choose from top 5
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Crossover - each gene can come from father or mother (50-50)
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Mutation prob 0.2
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Range 0.1
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Ya
24/02/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: Ok now you
24/02/21, 7:47 am - Pooja: s
Same
24/02/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: Splice it randomly from top 5 parents
24/02/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: Create 2 children from 2 parents
24/02/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: From the 10 children created mutate with prob 0.7
24/02/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: then out of 5 top parents and 10 children choose top 10
24/02/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: pop size 10 iterations 40
24/02/21, 7:49 am - mehul mathur: Wait parents too?
24/02/21, 7:49 am - mehul mathur: That Mallika stuff?
24/02/21, 8:06 am - mehul mathur: Wait so no concept of two parents per pair?
24/02/21, 8:07 am - mehul mathur: A gene can come from any of the 11*5 parameters of the top 5?
24/02/21, 8:36 am - mehul mathur: garrulous-wrong-uncovered-family

12/03/21, 12:51 am - Pooja: But did it change in the intermediate
12/03/21, 12:51 am - Pooja: Or the last one
12/03/21, 12:51 am - mehul mathur: which now has a y component

06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: thanks
06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: he understood
06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: it took time
06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: but i did it
06/04/21, 3:25 am - Manasvi💩: :)
06/04/21, 3:25 am - Manasvi💩: did he like the art
06/04/21, 3:25 am - Manasvi💩: you can promote it for me
06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: he kpet on interrupting me by saying mom made doasa i have to go eat
06/04/21, 3:25 am - mehul mathur: i was like no please understan
06/04/21, 3:26 am - mehul mathur: i dont think he even noticed
06/04/21, 3:26 am - mehul mathur: like it was so insignificant
06/04/21, 3:26 am - Manasvi💩: his existence is insignificant
06/04/21, 4:01 am - mehul mathur: where did theygive that sample code for cvxpy library?
06/04/21, 4:02 am - Manasvi💩: moodle
06/04/21, 4:03 am - mehul mathur: saw it
06/04/21, 4:41 am - mehul mathur: wait guys
06/04/21, 4:41 am - mehul mathur: what is the reward
06/04/21, 4:41 am - mehul mathur: when he is at the absorbing states?
06/04/21, 4:42 am - mehul mathur: like what will the number in the circle be when hes at a state where MM has zero health
06/04/21, 4:42 am - mehul mathur: itll be zero?
06/04/21, 5:05 am - Pooja: Yep
06/04/21, 5:06 am - mehul mathur: ok
06/04/21, 5:15 am - mehul mathur: wait so that means NONE action has reward zero right?
06/04/21, 5:22 am - mehul mathur: Also they said don't consider the transitions which loop back to the same state so do we consider that in the reward too ?
06/04/21, 5:22 am - mehul mathur: Like when we are calculating the weighted avg of reward so do we consider the probability of branch which it brings it back to the same state or no?
06/04/21, 5:35 am - Pooja: no we wont
06/04/21, 5:36 am - Pooja: and yeah none will have zero
06/04/21, 5:36 am - mehul mathur: but didnt they say
06/04/21, 5:36 am - mehul mathur: only dont consider it when forming A matrix?
06/04/21, 5:42 am - mehul mathur: ?
06/04/21, 5:42 am - mehul mathur: because i think like
06/04/21, 5:43 am - mehul mathur: step cost is still considered when you have a probabiloity to end up in the same state
06/04/21, 5:43 am - mehul mathur: cuz you did waste time na
06/04/21, 5:44 am - Manasvi💩: when do you end up in same state?
06/04/21, 5:44 am - Manasvi💩: i dont think you can?
06/04/21, 5:44 am - Manasvi💩: that'll be a self loop
06/04/21, 5:45 am - mehul mathur: yes you can
06/04/21, 5:45 am - mehul mathur: if you GATHER
06/04/21, 5:45 am - mehul mathur: and it fails
06/04/21, 5:45 am - mehul mathur: so we still have to tell the logic that if you fail a gather then time is wasted
06/04/21, 5:46 am - mehul mathur: should i ask on moodle
06/04/21, 5:47 am - Manasvi💩: <Media omitted>
06/04/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: bro ive read the pdf
06/04/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: it says wouldnt include in A matrix
06/04/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: also wait that means STAY action will never be considered even
06/04/21, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: ok 2 questions dimension of A matrix is 600 * 1936 and also in rewards everything is -20 except in the state where he can get attacked its -40 correct?
06/04/21, 6:35 am - Manasvi💩: yesyes
06/04/21, 7:20 am - mehul mathur: if you guys made the A matrix
06/04/21, 7:21 am - mehul mathur: the probability in A matrix where the state is absorbing and action is NONE , its 1.0 right?
06/04/21, 7:29 am - Pooja: Yep
06/04/21, 7:29 am - Pooja: Just like slide
06/04/21, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: how you guys printing it
06/04/21, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: its huge right
06/04/21, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: did you save in some file?
06/04/21, 7:29 am - Pooja: Printing what?
06/04/21, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: A matrix
06/04/21, 7:29 am - Manasvi💩: we didnt make yet
06/04/21, 7:29 am - Manasvi💩: lmao
06/04/21, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: oh
06/04/21, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: lmao
06/04/21, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: lmao
06/04/21, 8:13 am - mehul mathur: what is alpha
06/04/21, 8:13 am - mehul mathur: did they give us?
06/04/21, 8:19 am - Pooja: Yes
06/04/21, 8:19 am - Pooja: Check noodle starting state they gave
06/04/21, 8:20 am - mehul mathur: send no
06/04/21, 8:23 am - mehul mathur: (C,2,3,R,100) as the starting state. This will define the initialization of the alpha matrix. this right?
06/04/21, 8:23 am - mehul mathur: so its prob is 1 and rest 0?
06/04/21, 8:29 am - Pooja: yess
06/04/21, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: howd you guys make alpha into a column vector>
06/04/21, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: ?
06/04/21, 8:29 am - Pooja: We didnt code
06/04/21, 8:29 am - mehul mathur: ok ok

11/04/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: A more recently developed nucleotide-level BLAST program called MegaBLAST (7) is about 10 times faster than “blastn” but is designed to align sequences that are nearly identical, differing by only a few percent from one another. MegaBLAST allows the rapid mapping of a transcript onto a typical 3 billion base mammalian genome in seconds, and is useful for processing large batches of sequences. A refinement of MegaBLAST, known as discontiguous MegaBLAST, uses a discontiguous template to define an initial “word” in which characters in some positions, such as those in the wobble base position of codons, need not match. Discontiguous MegaBLAST allows rapid cross-species mappings involving coding regions in cases where species differences in codon usage would prevent alignments using the original MegaBLAST program.

11/04/21, 1:15 am - Pooja: # Q5.

i. 

- Uniprot size - consists of two sections Swiss-Prot ( contains 542,782 sequence entries )  and TrEMBL ( contains 54,247,468 sequence entries ).
- GenBank size - contains over 6.25 trillion base pairs from over 1.6 billion nucleotide sequences.

Number of matrix cells required for a DP between two sequences of length n and m, is n*m, as it requires a matrix F which is of dimensions n*m. For each DP run, the time required is $O(nm)$.

For a query sequence of length 1000 bases, the time would be size * O(1000*m) where m is the size of each protein sequence in the UniProt Database. 

ii.

Human Chr 1 (size : 248*10^6) and query sequence of 1000 bases - memory requirement : $O(284*10^6 * 10^3)$.

Human Chr 1 (size : 248*10^6) and Chr 1 of Mouse ~195Mbp - memory requirement : $O(284*10^6 * 195*10^6)$.

11/04/21, 2:41 am - mehul mathur: Where did he get the size?
11/04/21, 2:41 am - Pooja: The question is if I want to run with dp how long it takes
11/04/21, 2:41 am - Pooja: They probably dont actually do dp
11/04/21, 2:42 am - Pooja: No idea I asked what the first number meant
11/04/21, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: And
11/04/21, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: ?
11/04/21, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: Also for that question your second part is correct na?

11/04/21, 2:46 am - mehul mathur: It's not worth
11/04/21, 2:46 am - mehul mathur: I don't think he started
11/04/21, 2:46 am - mehul mathur: Lemme ask
11/04/21, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: wait this makes no sense
11/04/21, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: time is O(n * m) * database size
11/04/21, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: he did O(n * database size)
11/04/21, 3:53 am - mehul mathur: Ah I feel.lazy
11/04/21, 3:53 am - mehul mathur: Pooja mansi to doing automata or cg?

12/04/21, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: you started?
12/04/21, 7:38 am - Pooja: No
12/04/21, 7:38 am - Pooja: Howre you doing collisions
12/04/21, 7:38 am - Pooja: Cg
12/04/21, 7:38 am - mehul mathur: ya im doing that only right now
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: tryna make hitbox
12/04/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: oh
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: did you do enemies moving towards you
12/04/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: Is there some library
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: do they appear out of nowhere
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: ?
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: or come from edge
12/04/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: I need to havent done yet
12/04/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: I'm gonna do moving towards tou
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: oh then collisions with what
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: ok ok cool
12/04/21, 7:39 am - mehul mathur: ya cuz then it looks like we are moving forward
12/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: no library bro
12/04/21, 7:40 am - Pooja: Bro I wont finish lol
12/04/21, 7:40 am - Pooja: If theres no extension
12/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: hitbox like you remember jytotis code
12/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: there ill be
12/04/21, 7:40 am - Pooja: jyoti?
12/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: what you thinking itll be tomm morning only kya
12/04/21, 7:40 am - Pooja: ...
12/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: that detect collision they had
12/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: that bounding box they made remember
12/04/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: oh I didnt do like that
12/04/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: In among us assgn uh
12/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: like my bounding box of an object is just like it has the central x , z and width and depth
12/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: so if the boxes collide then ya
12/04/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: Its 2d game tho
12/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: how else can you do it
12/04/21, 7:41 am - Pooja: So like we dont have to worry about depth and stuff
12/04/21, 7:42 am - Pooja: yeah that inky
12/04/21, 7:42 am - mehul mathur: inky?
12/04/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: Only
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: ok so how did you do it
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: this one is also 2d game?
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: i mean by depth i meant like
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: i only ever care about my x coordinate and z coodrinate
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: so my bounding box is a rectangle in xz plane
12/04/21, 7:43 am - mehul mathur: like that
12/04/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: ok
12/04/21, 7:48 am - mehul mathur: bro how many days
12/04/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: Yeah the trailer made the game look all coll
12/04/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: But its actually lame
12/04/21, 7:48 am - mehul mathur: trailerr???
12/04/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: Like in the pdf
12/04/21, 7:48 am - mehul mathur: oh
12/04/21, 7:48 am - mehul mathur: how many days
12/04/21, 7:48 am - Pooja: idk

23/04/21, 7:21 am - mehul mathur: q3
23/04/21, 7:21 am - Pooja: how to solve tho
23/04/21, 7:22 am - mehul mathur: that utility
23/04/21, 7:22 am - Pooja: like what to fo
23/04/21, 7:22 am - Pooja: Do
23/04/21, 7:22 am - mehul mathur: is that pomdpeval
23/04/21, 7:22 am - Pooja: Then 4 also different no
23/04/21, 7:22 am - mehul mathur: ya maybe
23/04/21, 7:22 am - mehul mathur: ill ask people and let you know
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: ok good news
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: i now know what to do for q3,4,5
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: pooja our 4 is correct only
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: 3 ke liye
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: we get policies for q1 and q2
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: and run that pomdpeval
23/04/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: get expected reward thingy
23/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: thats the answer
23/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: for q5
23/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: we run policy according to q4
23/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: and the T (horizon) is nothing but the "trials" thing that shows up when we make the policy
23/04/21, 7:41 am - mehul mathur: you guys wanna quickly get it done?
23/04/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: eh can we do later
23/04/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: Wait
23/04/21, 7:43 am - Pooja: How to do this
23/04/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: Create initial belief state?
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: ya
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: only difference
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: this time its not unifor right
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: 0.4 0.6 like that
23/04/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: ohh okok
23/04/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: but like
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: bro wdym later its due
23/04/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: How to find those states
23/04/21, 7:44 am - Pooja: due tomorrow no
23/04/21, 7:44 am - mehul mathur: its given na that target is in one of those 4 states with 1/4 each
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: and agent is in either of those 2
23/04/21, 7:45 am - Pooja: Night can we do
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: and on and off its 0.5 each
23/04/21, 7:45 am - Pooja: ok finefine
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: so for eg.
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: if agent in 0,0   and target in 0,1
23/04/21, 7:45 am - Pooja: So its initial belief state only
23/04/21, 7:45 am - Pooja: Ya got it
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: then prob of state 0,0 - 0,1 - off  is 0.4 * 0.25*0.5
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: ya cool
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: at nigh?
23/04/21, 7:45 am - mehul mathur: ok
23/04/21, 7:46 am - mehul mathur: science codes later then

03/05/21, 7:29 am - mehul mathur: let manasvi do the advantage
03/05/21, 7:29 am - Pooja: bc randomly he ll choose the polarizer
03/05/21, 7:30 am - Manasvi💩: The obtained results show that the BB84 protocol exhibits better performance than B92 in the distribution of the secure communication key over long distance. Overall, these results reveal that it is possible to obtain secure key exchange in the low earth orbit, an idea which can be extended to other long distance laser links such as geostationary orbit.
03/05/21, 7:30 am - Manasvi💩: bb84 is better apparently
03/05/21, 7:30 am - mehul mathur: arey dont read some random shit
03/05/21, 7:31 am - Pooja: we dont need to do comparision
03/05/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: "The B92 protocol is easier to realize than BB84 and,
as we will see later, it can be applied to continuousvariable states. It is believed however to be less
secure than BB84"
03/05/21, 7:32 am - Pooja: what is he asking
03/05/21, 7:32 am - Pooja: rn
03/05/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: ill look more hold on
03/05/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: "Any two non-orthogonal states can be used for the B92 protocol. It is important though to have
states orthogonal to them, or at least approximately orthogonal"
03/05/21, 7:32 am - mehul mathur: @917674002626  say this after you rexplain
03/05/21, 7:32 am - Pooja: okay they said that
03/05/21, 7:32 am - Pooja: just now

03/05/21, 7:37 am - Pooja: so what tho
03/05/21, 7:37 am - Pooja: like whys that better than bb84
03/05/21, 7:37 am - mehul mathur: its easier

05/08/21, 4:24 am - Manasvi💩: Like last sem it's not like we used disocord or anything
05/08/21, 4:24 am - Manasvi💩: Discord*
05/08/21, 4:24 am - mehul mathur: For science what did we do
05/08/21, 4:24 am - mehul mathur: We didn't kya?
05/08/21, 4:24 am - mehul mathur: Legal discussion was there na
05/08/21, 4:24 am - Manasvi💩: Bro half of them weren't even there
05/08/21, 4:25 am - Manasvi💩: Thos guys formed their own group and shit
05/08/21, 4:25 am - Manasvi💩: Why you wanna make decisions based on what those guys are doing
05/08/21, 4:25 am - mehul mathur: Ok what is your reason for molecular one
05/08/21, 4:25 am - Manasvi💩: But then this molecular guy doesn't grade well
05/08/21, 4:25 am - Manasvi💩: So idk
05/08/21, 4:26 am - Manasvi💩: I dont
05/08/21, 4:26 am - mehul mathur: Might have chemistry and stuff
05/08/21, 4:26 am - Manasvi💩: Quantum and thermodynamics are just harder in general
05/08/21, 4:26 am - Manasvi💩: Atleast for me
05/08/21, 4:26 am - mehul mathur: Arey bro assignments and all will be easier like arjo Dhruv Kunwar and all they'll give
05/08/21, 4:26 am - mehul mathur: Why you assuming that they just abandoned us
06/08/21, 5:38 am - Pooja: Abey which science you guys took
06/08/21, 5:38 am - mehul mathur: I took open quantum systems
06/08/21, 5:38 am - Pooja: Oh fk
06/08/21, 5:38 am - Pooja: Quantum again
06/08/21, 5:39 am - mehul mathur: Yea

06/08/21, 5:41 am - Pooja: ah but still
06/08/21, 5:42 am - mehul mathur: They all have some quantum in them
06/08/21, 5:42 am - mehul mathur: Or they are biomolecules
06/08/21, 5:42 am - mehul mathur: I don't wanna do biology
06/08/21, 5:42 am - Pooja: Biology you mean biomolecules type shit
06/08/21, 5:42 am - Pooja: Ya that was also bad

26/08/21, 9:05 am - mehul mathur: Guys
26/08/21, 9:05 am - mehul mathur: We need to talk about IRE
26/08/21, 9:06 am - Manasvi💩: yes
26/08/21, 9:06 am - Manasvi💩: at 10?
26/08/21, 9:06 am - Manasvi💩: lets meet?

26/08/21, 9:09 am - Manasvi💩: whyre you so disgusting
26/08/21, 9:09 am - mehul mathur: Shark jaw
26/08/21, 11:26 am - mehul mathur: ok guys
26/08/21, 11:26 am - mehul mathur: come link?
26/08/21, 12:51 pm - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
26/08/21, 10:50 pm - mehul mathur: oye i think for infobox
26/08/21, 10:50 pm - mehul mathur: that nested thing isnt there
26/08/21, 10:50 pm - mehul mathur: like
26/08/21, 10:50 pm - mehul mathur: for that song contest thingy we saw
26/08/21, 10:51 pm - mehul mathur: there the values itself are infoboxes but i saw the wikipedia its nothing like that
26/08/21, 10:51 pm - mehul mathur: for infoboxes we can just do this and its enough ->  Find all indices starting {{Infobox
26/08/21, 10:51 pm - mehul mathur: than for each index
26/08/21, 10:52 pm - mehul mathur: stack wala thing till ending brackets
26/08/21, 10:52 pm - mehul mathur: thats it
26/08/21, 10:56 pm - Manasvi💩: ok
26/08/21, 10:56 pm - mehul mathur: and to avoid this case
{{Infobox a = 2 | b = 3 | c = {{Infobox | ....}} | d = 4 }}
26/08/21, 10:56 pm - mehul mathur: so here we dont wanna get the inner one
26/08/21, 10:56 pm - mehul mathur: cuz thats not an actual infobox its just a key value
26/08/21, 10:57 pm - mehul mathur: so when we find the end of the outer infobox we can do like now search for the other infobox after the index of the previous one ka end
26/08/21, 10:58 pm - mehul mathur: so {{Infobox a = 3 | b = 4 | c = {{Infobox 1=A | 2=B}} | d=4 }} ... {{Infobox key=val | key2=val2}}
26/08/21, 10:58 pm - mehul mathur: this case should give us ["a = 3 | b = 4 | c = {{Infobox 1=A | 2=B}} | d=4 " ,  "key=val | key2=val2"]
27/08/21, 12:14 am - mehul mathur: i have yet to see vausdev present any slides
27/08/21, 12:14 am - mehul mathur: he keeps talking
27/08/21, 2:47 am - mehul mathur: ok i found how to do references i put in notion
27/08/21, 2:59 am - mehul mathur: some things i saw you can do in those strings are:
in references you split by * , and then in each split element if it starts with {{ and ends with }} , you read inside that and split by | , otherwise if its inside [ ] , then its a link so take wats inside []
27/08/21, 2:59 am - mehul mathur: and similar in external links
27/08/21, 3:03 am - Pooja: So external links we re not taking the actual link rigjt
27/08/21, 3:03 am - mehul mathur: So the string you read inside sqaure brackets will have http link and a name
27/08/21, 3:03 am - mehul mathur: Usme se you clean the http part
27/08/21, 3:03 am - mehul mathur: And take the name
27/08/21, 3:03 am - Pooja: Hmm
27/08/21, 3:04 am - mehul mathur: If there is no name you take nothing
27/08/21, 3:04 am - mehul mathur: Theys said on moodle they want name only
27/08/21, 3:05 am - Pooja: Ok coolll
27/08/21, 3:06 am - mehul mathur: This I'm not too sure
27/08/21, 3:06 am - mehul mathur: Some references are like this
* {{Cite book | title = | author = }}
27/08/21, 3:24 am - mehul mathur: and i still have no idea how to do body
27/08/21, 6:26 am - Pooja: In that statue thing
27/08/21, 6:26 am - Pooja: What is the graph that has a triangle in jt
27/08/21, 6:26 am - mehul mathur: ya
27/08/21, 6:27 am - Pooja: Like above the graph that you get after transforming
27/08/21, 6:27 am - Pooja: ?
27/08/21, 6:27 am - mehul mathur: that is the CDFafter transforming
27/08/21, 6:27 am - Pooja: Yeah and there's two graphs to left of that
27/08/21, 6:27 am - Pooja: One is the new values you get
27/08/21, 6:27 am - mehul mathur: there are 4 graphs in total na
27/08/21, 6:27 am - mehul mathur: can you show the image
27/08/21, 6:27 am - Pooja: Above that one what is it
27/08/21, 6:28 am - Pooja: It's not in tb
27/08/21, 6:28 am - mehul mathur: ok ill start from right to upper right
27/08/21, 6:28 am - mehul mathur: the righ down one is original histogram
27/08/21, 6:28 am - Pooja: Upper right
27/08/21, 6:28 am - Pooja: Wait I'll draw pic lol
27/08/21, 6:28 am - mehul mathur: okk
27/08/21, 6:28 am - mehul mathur: also pooja in 2 mins kamal meet
27/08/21, 6:29 am - Pooja: <Media omitted>
27/08/21, 6:29 am - Pooja: Ik
27/08/21, 6:29 am - mehul mathur: ya that is the CDF of the transformed histogram
27/08/21, 6:29 am - Pooja: Oh okok
27/08/21, 6:30 am - mehul mathur: so going anticlockwise it is 
original histogram -> its cdf (which is the transformation) -> the transformed histogram -> its cdf
27/08/21, 6:30 am - Pooja: Come meet
27/08/21, 6:30 am - Pooja: He's saying hello
27/08/21, 6:30 am - mehul mathur: ya coming
27/08/21, 6:30 am - Pooja: Ya goddit goddit
29/08/21, 12:09 am - mehul mathur: guys you wanna meet once for IRE again today im stuck
29/08/21, 12:45 am - Pooja: Ya okk
29/08/21, 12:50 am - mehul mathur: Tell time?
29/08/21, 12:50 am - mehul mathur: You deleted this message

29/08/21, 2:43 am - mehul mathur: https://meet.google.com/crf-gmtp-mid
30/08/21, 3:22 am - mehul mathur: I just realized
30/08/21, 3:23 am - mehul mathur: I have been storing what I get from the parser in an array and then processing on that array to create a dict
30/08/21, 3:23 am - mehul mathur: But you can't do that
30/08/21, 3:23 am - mehul mathur: In the parser class only you have to keep making them into tokens
30/08/21, 3:23 am - mehul mathur: And simultaneously store
30/08/21, 4:45 am - Manasvi💩: why not
30/08/21, 4:52 am - mehul mathur: because
30/08/21, 4:52 am - mehul mathur: memory
30/08/21, 4:52 am - mehul mathur: lol
30/08/21, 7:46 am - mehul mathur: next week is quiz week apparently
30/08/21, 7:46 am - mehul mathur: we will unite
30/08/21, 8:00 am - Pooja: F
31/08/21, 5:51 am - mehul mathur: bro why do these rohan asokan and all gotta flex
31/08/21, 5:51 am - mehul mathur: like who asked hyou
31/08/21, 5:51 am - mehul mathur: you
31/08/21, 5:53 am - Pooja: How do you find g tho?
31/08/21, 5:53 am - mehul mathur: CDF na
31/08/21, 5:53 am - mehul mathur: G is CDF of p(z)
31/08/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: But we are trying to get p(z)
31/08/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: We don't know it yet right?
31/08/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: oh fuk
31/08/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: ya XD
31/08/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: ask ask
31/08/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: on chat
31/08/21, 5:55 am - Pooja: I think that's what he's saying right noe
31/08/21, 5:55 am - Pooja: Actually
31/08/21, 5:55 am - Pooja: Like match to this image similar type
31/08/21, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: oh that reference image?
31/08/21, 5:55 am - Pooja: Ig so?
31/08/21, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: no but then whats the point
31/08/21, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: you have already reference
31/08/21, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: oh wait
31/08/21, 5:55 am - Pooja: Ig the discrete stuff gives like the function?
31/08/21, 5:55 am - mehul mathur: you can just use a test image
31/08/21, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: with the same hostogram
31/08/21, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: like the histogram you want
31/08/21, 5:56 am - Pooja: Test image?
31/08/21, 5:56 am - Pooja: But I'm thinking like
31/08/21, 5:56 am - Pooja: If you already have your histogram
31/08/21, 5:56 am - Pooja: Then whagre you trying to find?
31/08/21, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: we are trying to transform the test image
31/08/21, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: by making its histogram look a certain wat
31/08/21, 5:56 am - mehul mathur: way
31/08/21, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: now different images can have the same histogram
31/08/21, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: so i can just make a fake image with the histogram im looking for
31/08/21, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: and then get G from that
31/08/21, 5:57 am - mehul mathur: but im not sure ask no
31/08/21, 5:57 am - Pooja: Yeah ig so
31/08/21, 5:57 am - Pooja: That makes sense I think
31/08/21, 5:58 am - Pooja: Like that's why the matching thin he was saying
31/08/21, 5:58 am - mehul mathur: i didnt listen during matching thing
31/08/21, 5:58 am - mehul mathur: matching as in
31/08/21, 6:00 am - Pooja: Like take similar images
31/08/21, 6:01 am - Pooja: Do you think this is how filters work maybe
31/08/21, 6:02 am - mehul mathur: yaaa
31/08/21, 6:02 am - mehul mathur: histogram equalization
31/08/21, 6:07 am - mehul mathur: what is difference between global and local one
31/08/21, 6:08 am - Pooja: Local is like in a small part of imGe
31/08/21, 6:08 am - Pooja: Global is like full thing
31/08/21, 6:08 am - mehul mathur: ya so that one is you choose a patch and and map the center of that patch to a new point
31/08/21, 6:08 am - mehul mathur: using the whole local patch
31/08/21, 6:09 am - Pooja: So he's like comapring intensity of a small area to the whole image to see if you wanna do something with it or not
31/08/21, 6:09 am - mehul mathur: what is global then
31/08/21, 6:09 am - Pooja: Should we ask this p thing
31/08/21, 6:10 am - mehul mathur: What you asked kya?
31/08/21, 6:10 am - mehul mathur: Ask
31/08/21, 6:11 am - Pooja: He asjed
31/08/21, 6:11 am - Pooja: Abba
31/08/21, 6:11 am - Pooja: He daid
31/08/21, 6:11 am - Pooja: Yes
31/08/21, 6:11 am - Pooja: We need this target histogram
31/08/21, 6:12 am - Pooja: Nice
31/08/21, 6:12 am - mehul mathur: bro check dm
01/09/21, 5:14 am - mehul mathur: This assignment is fuking with me
01/09/21, 5:14 am - mehul mathur: Now my index ka size is much more than 1/4th the size of the big file
01/09/21, 5:15 am - mehul mathur: Big file is 184M
01/09/21, 5:15 am - mehul mathur: Index is 117M
01/09/21, 5:15 am - mehul mathur: 😭😭
01/09/21, 5:15 am - mehul mathur: Can we meet today to figure this out
01/09/21, 5:29 am - Pooja: Remove the -
01/09/21, 5:29 am - Pooja: 😂😂
01/09/21, 5:29 am - Pooja: How's that possible lmao

01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: Nah
01/09/21, 5:30 am - mehul mathur: How much is yours
01/09/21, 5:30 am - mehul mathur: Oh
01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: I didn't create the big one only yet
01/09/21, 5:30 am - mehul mathur: Kya?
01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: Try this nooo
01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: Do like
01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: Replace all on vscode

01/09/21, 5:30 am - mehul mathur: Arey which - baba
01/09/21, 5:30 am - Pooja: The way you're storing indexes baba
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Which format are you saying
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Token:query-d6(2)
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Like this
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Or
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Token:d5-query6
01/09/21, 5:31 am - mehul mathur: Like that
01/09/21, 5:31 am - Pooja: First see if it makes a difference ig
01/09/21, 5:31 am - Pooja: Then we ll worry about changing if required
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: Ya cuz
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: If I have to change the order now
01/09/21, 5:32 am - Pooja: Replace allll
01/09/21, 5:32 am - Pooja: Do now only
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: It'll take so much
01/09/21, 5:32 am - Pooja: It'll take 2 seconds
01/09/21, 5:32 am - Pooja: Yaaa
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: Okok
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: What is keybinding
01/09/21, 5:32 am - mehul mathur: For replaceall
01/09/21, 5:32 am - Pooja: Control h
01/09/21, 5:34 am - Pooja: What happened
01/09/21, 5:34 am - Pooja: Helped or no it's useless
01/09/21, 5:34 am - mehul mathur: Ya ya wait vscode slow
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: Not that big of a difference
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: Removed semicolons
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: And dashes
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: 117 to 104 only
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: I think format we'll have to change
01/09/21, 5:47 am - Pooja: Then what to do now 😶
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: Also I asked Dhruv his thing takes 100s for full index creation
01/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: Mine takes 100 for just the making into blocks part
01/09/21, 5:47 am - Pooja: How big is his index
01/09/21, 5:48 am - Manasvi💩: its probably your laptop speed
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: 40M
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: And same number of tokens as me 😂
01/09/21, 5:48 am - Pooja: Someone on moodle was saying they made separate indexes for each field
01/09/21, 5:48 am - Pooja: Oh wow whatt
01/09/21, 5:48 am - Pooja: Format then right?
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: Ya format then
01/09/21, 5:48 am - Pooja: Mmm
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: Document first
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: Then title
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: Query I mean
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: And time ka tob
01/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: Toh

01/09/21, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: I got it too 140s
01/09/21, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: Full think till the big index creatio
01/09/21, 1:52 pm - mehul mathur: And index file is 60M
01/09/21, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: and like if i remove every single punctuation
01/09/21, 1:58 pm - mehul mathur: then also it goes till 56M

03/09/21, 6:15 am - Manasvi💩: i didnt understand how second derivatve gives answer
03/09/21, 6:16 am - mehul mathur: lol
03/09/21, 6:16 am - mehul mathur: thats so easy
03/09/21, 6:16 am - Pooja: How the values match up right?
03/09/21, 6:16 am - Pooja: It doesn't add up
03/09/21, 6:16 am - mehul mathur: when the second derivative ka graph
03/09/21, 6:17 am - mehul mathur: intersects with 0 line
03/09/21, 6:17 am - Manasvi💩: WHY SHE IN SUCH HURRRRYYY
03/09/21, 6:17 am - Manasvi💩: bitch
03/09/21, 6:17 am - mehul mathur: edge is there

03/09/21, 6:18 am - mehul mathur: what values
03/09/21, 6:18 am - Pooja: That scan line and the derivatives below
03/09/21, 6:18 am - mehul mathur: oh ok
03/09/21, 6:18 am - mehul mathur: it doesnt
03/09/21, 6:18 am - mehul mathur: its just
03/09/21, 6:18 am - Pooja: Like first dervivage and second are one off
03/09/21, 6:18 am - Manasvi💩: its just differeence between adjancent numbers
03/09/21, 6:18 am - Pooja: Like the
03/09/21, 6:18 am - Pooja: Index
03/09/21, 6:18 am - mehul mathur: cur diff = cur value - prev value
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: Ya
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Manasvi💩: yeah shes ignore first and last
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: No I mean likr
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Manasvi💩: ignoring*
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: Take the cell with 6 that's just before the 5
03/09/21, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: ha
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: So it's the second derivative matched with that is -1 ya
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: But then it should be 0 for first derivative
03/09/21, 6:19 am - Pooja: But like it's one off
03/09/21, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: second derivative is crrent first derivative - previous first derivative
03/09/21, 6:20 am - Pooja: Like pushed one off
03/09/21, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: ya second derivative will have one more offset pixel
03/09/21, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: cuz you have to start counting from 3rd pixel onwards
03/09/21, 6:21 am - Pooja: Oh okok

14/09/21, 11:33 am - Manasvi💩: on his 300 files only we can do off binary
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: I'll spend time on this jugaad only
14/09/21, 11:33 am - Manasvi💩: yeah ditch
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: Doesn't matter
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: I don't understand
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: You know na
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: 300 files
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: Or 1 21 g
14/09/21, 11:33 am - mehul mathur: Same thing
14/09/21, 11:33 am - Manasvi💩: yeah so to decide which file
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: that we do
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: and then on that one file
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: we do binary
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: so its just 100,000
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: uska log
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: right?
14/09/21, 11:34 am - mehul mathur: I don't get it
14/09/21, 11:34 am - mehul mathur: How does it make a difference
14/09/21, 11:34 am - mehul mathur: Doing binary on 27 parts
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: ok come call in a bit?
14/09/21, 11:34 am - mehul mathur: Or 300 parts
14/09/21, 11:34 am - mehul mathur: Ya coming
14/09/21, 11:34 am - Manasvi💩: im downloading his files
14/09/21, 11:35 am - Manasvi💩: we can stare at it and decide what to do
14/09/21, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: Also guys
14/09/21, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: We only have to run search in evals na
14/09/21, 1:14 pm - Pooja: yeah
14/09/21, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: Like cuz we are using his index fine
14/09/21, 1:14 pm - mehul mathur: But our index creation code
14/09/21, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: Should be as if we are making like his
14/09/21, 1:15 pm - Pooja: no so
14/09/21, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
14/09/21, 1:15 pm - mehul mathur: Ha bolo
14/09/21, 1:17 pm - Manasvi💩: Will they check?
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: I mean it's not hard to make it like that na
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: Also then fornsure we are also makimg it into 385 files na
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - Manasvi💩: Yeah
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - Pooja: boa and all that shit youre doing?
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - mehul mathur: No not boa
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - Pooja: then
14/09/21, 1:18 pm - Manasvi💩: We don't need to no?
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Pooja: why cant we just do it with ours
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: We can either stick to 27 files or 385
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Pooja: 27 files
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Manasvi💩: You said he's not doing bonaty
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: That I'm saying
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Pooja: and go over search time
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Pooja: its fine
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: No no
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: 385 has nothing to do with
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: Boa
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Manasvi💩: But that's extra work
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: Or search time
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Manasvi💩: Ya
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Manasvi💩: Binary*
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: Bonaty
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - Pooja: exactly
14/09/21, 1:19 pm - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Pooja: we just go over search time
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Pooja: screw his index also
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: Huh what
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Pooja: we ll code search with our phase 1 index
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Pooja: and go over search time
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: Oh
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: Ohhh
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Manasvi💩: What?
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: That's what you were saying
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Pooja: yeahh
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: Thats
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: I mean
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - Manasvi💩: I didn't understand
14/09/21, 1:20 pm - mehul mathur: Arey she's saying donthis phase like phase 1
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: yeah
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: exactly
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: During evals
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Manasvi💩: So you wanna merge his files now?
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: It'll be very funny during evals
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: not merge also
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: Noooo
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: we just know
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: She's saying ditch index
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: that our search works
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: with small
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: And let's juat code search
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: so itll work with big
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - mehul mathur: With small
14/09/21, 1:21 pm - Pooja: and yeah
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - Pooja: exactly
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - mehul mathur: That sounds so tempting
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - Manasvi💩: Wait why
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - mehul mathur: Should we do it like that
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - Pooja: bc whatll we do with this index
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - Manasvi💩: No but what if it goes over 6s with big fle
14/09/21, 1:22 pm - Manasvi💩: Bro that's so much risk for no reason
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: Abey
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: yeah
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: it will
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: Also then on that case after deadlone
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: im saying let it
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: She said let it go over 6 second
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: its fine
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: Pooja has given up
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: I also want to
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: yes
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: We have to still create our own index file
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: But we did this much pooja
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: Who said
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: You wanna do assignment after deadline also ah
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - mehul mathur: We don't have to submit it
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: Bro how will you run search in eval
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: yeah
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Manasvi💩: What you saying
14/09/21, 1:23 pm - Pooja: we can do it tomorrow
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - mehul mathur: Oh wait pooja ya
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - mehul mathur: Where will we run search
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: we ll get index
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: after deadline no
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: thats fine
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Manasvi💩: Lets just use his no
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: issue is time now
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: its too complicated bro
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Manasvi💩: Why do you wanna do after also
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: merging all that shit
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: bc at least something is there
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: ok fk this
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Manasvi💩: We don't have to noo
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - mehul mathur: Oh so after deadline we do all the merging
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: im not doing ire
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: im doing adobe shit
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - mehul mathur: Besttt
14/09/21, 1:24 pm - Pooja: gn im flaking
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: What gn
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: You have to do ml
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: Linear regression
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - Pooja: gn to you
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: Oh
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: Ok
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: Woah
14/09/21, 1:25 pm - mehul mathur: Gn
14/09/21, 2:48 pm - mehul mathur: Ok I have extracted the index
14/09/21, 2:48 pm - mehul mathur: 20 G my laptop wants to cry
14/09/21, 6:32 pm - Pooja: Hey! I'm really sorry this took so long, but OneDrive was being a bitch, I straight up uploaded the file 4-5 times and each time at 90% it ran into an error. So instead I made an account on Mega (fortunately they allow 20GB free storage). Here's the link: https://mega.nz/file/1p03TCpa#x18qbIGRAOzKc6pdUdq6Pk0sNGwHX5FwA3IPgjj2Tlk . Let me know if you're able to download it from here. If not I'll look at some other options
14/09/21, 6:32 pm - Pooja: Also, share the link with Mehul and Manasvi if they need it
14/09/21, 6:33 pm - Pooja: It's on drive it should take lesser time to download than wiki
14/09/21, 6:33 pm - Pooja: Dhruv sent
14/09/21, 9:57 pm - mehul mathur: Ya I saw
14/09/21, 9:58 pm - mehul mathur: I mean I still can't download it loo
14/09/21, 9:58 pm - mehul mathur: But nice
14/09/21, 10:17 pm - Pooja: Im running locally now
14/09/21, 10:17 pm - Pooja: Idk how this helps
14/09/21, 10:17 pm - Pooja: Since we re not doing anything different for search right?
14/09/21, 10:17 pm - Pooja: Like the thing is
14/09/21, 10:17 pm - Pooja: Aakash isn't binary searching files
14/09/21, 10:18 pm - Pooja: so his took very long
14/09/21, 10:18 pm - Pooja: I'm not sure but I think if we binary search files it'll be fine only?
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - mehul mathur: He brings the file locally and then binary searches
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - mehul mathur: Cuz of each of his index file is small
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - Pooja: But he like loads everything to memory
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - Pooja: And reads full file
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - mehul mathur: Ya so jist one
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - Pooja: We don't readline full file right
14/09/21, 10:24 pm - Pooja: So it'll take way less time?
14/09/21, 10:25 pm - mehul mathur: Ya ig
14/09/21, 10:25 pm - Pooja: When we searched with oir
14/09/21, 10:26 pm - Pooja: Phase1 index
14/09/21, 10:26 pm - Pooja: How long did it take
14/09/21, 10:26 pm - Pooja: Like instant?
14/09/21, 10:27 pm - mehul mathur: Yea it was instant
14/09/21, 10:27 pm - Pooja: So max to max
14/09/21, 10:27 pm - mehul mathur: No the thing is each his file is 100K
14/09/21, 10:27 pm - Pooja: One of our index will be
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: 2 gb big
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: So loading file in memory
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: And the phase 1 index
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: Takes nothing
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: Was 50 mb
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: Oh hmmmm
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: And then binary search on the loaded dict now takes instatanananat
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: Instant of Instant
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: Yeah butt lile
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: Also
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: In the tut
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: They split by alphabet
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: Also pooja
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: Right
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: So there must be a way like that
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - Pooja: It's not like his 300 index is the only way
14/09/21, 10:28 pm - mehul mathur: His index in his format
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - mehul mathur: Is 21 Gb
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: Yeahhh that's what
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - mehul mathur: With the hexadecimal
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: I think size will go
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: Yeahyeah
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - mehul mathur: Our format
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - mehul mathur: Will be huge
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - mehul mathur: Without boa and all that too
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: Yeppp
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: They said has to be 1/4
14/09/21, 10:29 pm - Pooja: So hopefully if it doesn't cross 30 gb it's not too bad?
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - mehul mathur: Ya so since we are sacrificing search time now
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - Pooja: Like we didn't use any index compression stuff that's there in tb
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - mehul mathur: Like we're letting that go up
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - mehul mathur: No but
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - mehul mathur: Im hexa
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - mehul mathur: 15 will be stored as single letter F
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - Pooja: yeah
14/09/21, 10:30 pm - Pooja: I ran mine already
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - Pooja: If it goes up it goes up xD
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - mehul mathur: You ran already matlab
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - Pooja: Locally
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - mehul mathur: You have index already?
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - Pooja: Like with our normal index code
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - Pooja: No it's running
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - mehul mathur: Hm okok
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - Pooja: mmm yeah
14/09/21, 10:31 pm - mehul mathur: Cuz I realized I can't comvert his thing to my format also
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Why
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - mehul mathur: I have his 20G
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - mehul mathur: And now inhave to convert that
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Yeah
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - mehul mathur: Into my possibly 30G
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - mehul mathur: No space :(
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Whichll take some time but then you'll have index at least
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Ohhh fuckkkk
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Areyy
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: You have usb?
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: Put it on usb or something
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - Pooja: The 20 gb
14/09/21, 10:32 pm - mehul mathur: Unless I like delete his file while converting
14/09/21, 10:33 pm - mehul mathur: Hm yeah usb maybe
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - mehul mathur: Ahh but all that to have an oversized index and long search time
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - mehul mathur: I'll see
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - mehul mathur: You have interview beyy
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - mehul mathur: All the bestt
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - Pooja: Yeahhh
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - Pooja: Revisingg
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - Pooja: All mdl notes lol
14/09/21, 10:34 pm - Pooja: Thank youuu
14/09/21, 11:17 pm - mehul mathur: Ok I have 1TB free in a hard drive
14/09/21, 11:18 pm - mehul mathur: Do you think I should just do it from there
14/09/21, 11:18 pm - mehul mathur: Like dump and all
14/09/21, 11:18 pm - mehul mathur: I'll have to keep it attsched throughout full operation
14/09/21, 11:20 pm - mehul mathur: or just convert aakashs index using this
15/09/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: Wtf
15/09/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: You have then do with dump
15/09/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: Why you want to convert aakashs now
15/09/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: Let yours run
15/09/21, 12:22 am - Pooja: It'll be done by tomorrow morning
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: No bro fuk that
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: Anyways I would have had to change it to hex
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: With decimal it would have gone till 30-40G
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: So I'll convert his
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: Using hardrive
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: And remove some tokens arbitrarily
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: So that our number of tokens are not the same
15/09/21, 12:30 am - mehul mathur: And yea
15/09/21, 12:31 am - mehul mathur: While his thing is converting I'll code search
15/09/21, 12:31 am - mehul mathur: Oh so right so I'm converting but I'm still using hexadecimal only
15/09/21, 12:31 am - mehul mathur: He said that is fine cuz we can tell them that for phase 2 we adapted
15/09/21, 12:31 am - mehul mathur: But rest of format I'll change
15/09/21, 12:32 am - mehul mathur: Like his is token hex hex
15/09/21, 12:32 am - mehul mathur: I'll make it token:dhexdhex
15/09/21, 12:32 am - mehul mathur: Like that
15/09/21, 12:37 am - mehul mathur: Plus if I see that tomm morning it has some errors
15/09/21, 12:37 am - mehul mathur: I'll just die
15/09/21, 1:05 am - Pooja: Damn saw what Ravi Kiran sent

16/09/21, 12:11 pm - Pooja: Do you add weight after calculating tfidf for a field
16/09/21, 12:11 pm - mehul mathur: weight = tf*idf
16/09/21, 12:11 pm - Pooja: Like the score is a sum of all the tfids for each field right
16/09/21, 12:11 pm - Pooja: So there you multiply the weight when adding?
16/09/21, 12:11 pm - mehul mathur: oh liek that

16/09/21, 12:11 pm - mehul mathur: only tf
16/09/21, 12:12 pm - mehul mathur: only tf is sep for fields
16/09/21, 12:12 pm - Pooja: So the tf you calculate as weight*tf
16/09/21, 12:12 pm - mehul mathur: like fo T2B3 -> tf = weight of title * 2 + weight of body * 3
16/09/21, 12:12 pm - Pooja: And then sum it up
16/09/21, 12:12 pm - mehul mathur: ha

27/09/21, 12:09 pm - Pooja: yeah doesnt make sense
28/09/21, 5:46 am - Pooja: What is ju
28/09/21, 5:46 am - Pooja: What she said
28/09/21, 5:46 am - mehul mathur: j is iota
28/09/21, 5:46 am - mehul mathur: u is that pixel
28/09/21, 5:46 am - Manasvi💩: complex
28/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: ok sorry
28/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: x,y are spatial directions
28/09/21, 5:47 am - mehul mathur: u and v are same orthogonal directions but in frequency domain
28/09/21, 5:48 am - mehul mathur: its that M,N
28/09/21, 5:48 am - Pooja: Ya goddit
28/09/21, 5:49 am - Pooja: Analogus xD
28/09/21, 5:51 am - mehul mathur: what were bandpass filters again
28/09/21, 5:51 am - Pooja: Allows a range of freq
28/09/21, 5:53 am - mehul mathur: so what is bandreject and notc
28/09/21, 5:53 am - Pooja: Size of range
28/09/21, 5:53 am - Pooja: She said notch is very sharp
28/09/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: And band is a bigger range
28/09/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: I think notch rejects
28/09/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: Only?
28/09/21, 5:54 am - mehul mathur: so notch is just narrower
28/09/21, 5:54 am - Pooja: Yeah
28/09/21, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: pooja this last shifting part you got kya?
28/09/21, 6:21 am - Pooja: Kinda I think
28/09/21, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: Egsplain no a lil bit
28/09/21, 6:21 am - Pooja: I stopped listening when she was explainin code tho
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: I think like take image
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: Pad that shit
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: And then center shift it
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: Then put dft on the center shift thing
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: Multiply with the filter
28/09/21, 6:22 am - Pooja: And ya then undo everythin?
28/09/21, 6:23 am - Pooja: Idft and multiply by that -1 term to get it back to shift again
28/09/21, 6:23 am - Pooja: Are you asking that -1 thing?
28/09/21, 6:24 am - mehul mathur: Yea like mainly thag
28/09/21, 6:24 am - Pooja: There's some property
28/09/21, 6:24 am - Pooja: We don't need to know proof
28/09/21, 6:24 am - mehul mathur: So doing that -1 thing shifts it in frequency domain right
28/09/21, 6:24 am - mehul mathur: Not spatial
28/09/21, 6:24 am - Pooja: no it only becomes frequency after we do dft to it na
28/09/21, 6:24 am - Pooja: Am I right
28/09/21, 6:25 am - Pooja: Shes saying if in frequency we want to shift then do this in spatial
28/09/21, 6:25 am - mehul mathur: No I mean like you have to first multiply with the -1 thing and then when you do dft it's a shifted dft
28/09/21, 6:25 am - Pooja: Yeah
28/09/21, 6:27 am - mehul mathur: why does she keep going
28/09/21, 6:27 am - mehul mathur: no ones listening

18/11/21, 9:38 am - mehul mathur: Hi guys, 
We had a meet with Registrar, Dean, SAC, SLC. 

*1. Campus Guidelines*
- As CHMC chair wasn't no final take was taken
- There will be open house next week attended by Director, Registrar 
- After that the decision on policy will be made in chmc meet with chair, student reps, "the experts"

*2. Returning back to campus*
- Institute will be following this schedule as discussed (will be officially informed soon) 
-- UG2 8th
-- PG1+UG3(electric) 15th
-- UG3 rest 23rd
-- Rest of all 30th
- Ofc we raised all the concerns about the return and they did what they are good at. 

So *once official* as per their advice feel free to spam them (and cc parliament too🙂) if you can't make to assigned slot.

27/11/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: Ya that ok
27/11/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: But in the formula itself
27/11/21, 7:39 am - Pooja: Why we have to do this make blurred image smaller I don't get
27/11/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: So that
27/11/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: DelS * k and delB
27/11/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: Are same size
27/11/21, 7:40 am - mehul mathur: I'll explain later let this happen firsg

27/11/21, 12:09 pm - Pooja: Look at answer 1
27/11/21, 12:10 pm - Pooja: You think we re doing it wrong bc we re not talking the outer convolution with the flipped kernel?
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: waitt
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: so laksh is actually right no
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - mehul mathur: its convolution of convolution only
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - Pooja: Yeah
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - Pooja: But like
27/11/21, 1:02 pm - Pooja: That flipping filter thing
27/11/21, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: ya ya convolution by definition is flipping and doing the window
27/11/21, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: are but
27/11/21, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: even if we flip the k
27/11/21, 1:03 pm - mehul mathur: how would it matter right?

25/01/22, 3:36 am - Pooja: Ask fhem
25/01/22, 3:38 am - mehul mathur: "Please see that for Question 1 and Question 2, you are supposed to use Collaborative Filtering. The most common method for Collaborative Filtering is to find a vector of latent features for each user (Generally using Matrix Factorization, using sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD) and then applying kNN.

*The Jaccard Index must be only used by you to evaluate yourself and was disclosed to you to dispel doubts regarding how we will be grading your submissions. No one must be found employing Jaccard Index directly as a distance metric.*


Since less time is left now, we are allowing you to use *sklearn library for matrix factorization only*.

*Please note kNN still needs to written from scratch in these two questions.*

This will also be making the doubt of not being able to use Jaccard index in Faiss or other libraries a non-issue I believe."
25/01/22, 3:38 am - mehul mathur: this one only
25/01/22, 3:38 am - mehul mathur: they said question 1 and 2 both vector way we have to do'

25/01/22, 3:44 am - Pooja: Wait so
25/01/22, 3:44 am - Pooja: What do they mean knn from scratch
25/01/22, 3:44 am - Pooja: Second question we use that library right tf are we doing from scratch there for knn

05/03/22, 12:03 am - Pooja: Actual value?
05/03/22, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: Ya
05/03/22, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: The class
05/03/22, 12:05 am - mehul mathur: L is the slack variable basically
05/03/22, 12:15 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
05/03/22, 12:15 am - mehul mathur: This is part 1 of that q
05/03/22, 12:18 am - Pooja: How do you get j with that constraint normally
05/03/22, 12:18 am - Pooja: Like Lagrange changes na
05/03/22, 12:18 am - mehul mathur: Wdym
05/03/22, 12:19 am - mehul mathur: For gradient?
05/03/22, 12:19 am - Pooja: Ya i thought j is after you do that Lagrange thing
05/03/22, 12:19 am - Pooja: Not just the original function you want to optimize
05/03/22, 12:22 am - mehul mathur: I mean he could have gotten this J
05/03/22, 12:22 am - mehul mathur: After all that
05/03/22, 12:24 am - mehul mathur: What you writing for that
05/03/22, 12:33 am - mehul mathur: <Media omitted>
05/03/22, 12:34 am - mehul mathur: Wait how to uploaddd??!

05/03/22, 12:41 am - mehul mathur: Helolo
05/03/22, 12:44 am - Pooja: idkkkk
05/03/22, 12:44 am - Pooja: I didn't write fully fully.pca lasso
05/03/22, 12:44 am - Pooja: Should've write
05/03/22, 12:44 am - Pooja: Bro but i think the j they are asking here is Lagrange
05/03/22, 12:44 am - Pooja: ka j
05/03/22, 12:45 am - mehul mathur: La Grange ka J is kyaa
05/03/22, 12:45 am - mehul mathur: We didn't study lagrange in slack
05/03/22, 12:45 am - Manasvi💩: He did no Lagrange
05/03/22, 12:45 am - Manasvi💩: In slacj
05/03/22, 12:45 am - Manasvi💩: Slack*
05/03/22, 12:47 am - mehul mathur: I mean what did you write
05/03/22, 12:47 am - mehul mathur: In that q
05/03/22, 12:50 am - Pooja: I wrote what you wrote only
05/03/22, 12:50 am - Pooja: But I'm confused still
05/03/22, 12:50 am - Pooja: Is that J they gave the Lagrange or just that function we want to minimize given some constraints
05/03/22, 12:51 am - mehul mathur: Ohhh
05/03/22, 12:51 am - mehul mathur: No that L is hundred percent slack variablr
05/03/22, 12:51 am - Pooja: Haanh that makes sense
05/03/22, 12:51 am - mehul mathur: That J is what they arrived at
05/03/22, 12:51 am - Pooja: But this J what it is I'm kinda confused?
05/03/22, 12:51 am - mehul mathur: After all langrange and all
05/03/22, 12:51 am - Pooja: Yeah exactly
05/03/22, 12:52 am - mehul mathur: So how does it affect answer
05/03/22, 12:52 am - Pooja: So we should've compared it with our Lagrange thing na
05/03/22, 12:52 am - mehul mathur: I mean I wrote a line at the end
05/03/22, 12:52 am - Pooja: Like you were like it's equivalent to the minimised function
05/03/22, 12:52 am - mehul mathur: Two lagranges behave same
05/03/22, 12:52 am - Pooja: But not that whole big ass Lagrange one
05/03/22, 12:52 am - Pooja: Huhhh
05/03/22, 12:54 am - mehul mathur: Yea I saw that written in discord

15/03/22, 3:09 am - mehul mathur: I'm parijaating wait there
15/03/22, 4:12 am - mehul mathur: I know you guys don't like me being around and all but waiting for someone if they tell you to wait is general decency
15/03/22, 4:12 am - mehul mathur: But lite
15/03/22, 4:15 am - Pooja: Didnt see you it was hot
15/03/22, 4:15 am - Manasvi💩: I thought you said you would wait lol
15/03/22, 4:16 am - Manasvi💩: Sorry
15/03/22, 5:27 am - Pooja: Did you start cogsci
15/03/22, 6:38 am - mehul mathur: No
15/03/22, 6:46 am - mehul mathur: Lab?
15/03/22, 6:46 am - mehul mathur: I'm there only cvit ac area come
15/03/22, 6:50 am - Manasvi💩: Ya ok I'll come
15/03/22, 6:51 am - mehul mathur: Okey
15/03/22, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: I'll wait at vc Or you'll take time?
15/03/22, 6:52 am - mehul mathur: Also @919980677602 ?
15/03/22, 8:18 am - Pooja: Helo any progress
15/03/22, 8:18 am - mehul mathur: Startinf now
15/03/22, 8:18 am - mehul mathur: It has bert and regression and all
15/03/22, 8:18 am - mehul mathur: We might be fucked
15/03/22, 8:32 am - mehul mathur: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-output-regression-models-with-python/
but this should be what we looking for tho
15/03/22, 8:33 am - Pooja: Huh
15/03/22, 8:33 am - Pooja: No
15/03/22, 8:33 am - Pooja: Why
15/03/22, 8:33 am - Pooja: Idts
15/03/22, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: why not?
15/03/22, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: we need to predict multidimensional output na
15/03/22, 8:34 am - mehul mathur: like the output of the linear reg is not just a number its a vector now
15/03/22, 8:45 am - Pooja: But models work the same
15/03/22, 8:45 am - mehul mathur: as in?
15/03/22, 8:47 am - Pooja: you read the article?
15/03/22, 8:47 am - mehul mathur: this one yea?
15/03/22, 8:47 am - Pooja: they use linear regresssion and everything the same way
15/03/22, 8:47 am - mehul mathur: ha ya ik
15/03/22, 8:47 am - Pooja: im confused how we use cross validation
15/03/22, 8:47 am - mehul mathur: cross validation we have to make on our own tho i think
15/03/22, 8:47 am - mehul mathur: because the evaluation metric is what they want not a predefined scoring function
15/03/22, 8:48 am - Pooja: So we asked jashn
15/03/22, 8:48 am - Pooja: He said you can use any evaluation metric to train model
15/03/22, 8:49 am - Pooja: But use the one they gave on test set
15/03/22, 8:49 am - Pooja: And report that accuracy
15/03/22, 8:49 am - Pooja: So then we can use sklearn stuff
15/03/22, 8:49 am - mehul mathur: arey but look in pdf
15/03/22, 8:49 am - mehul mathur: it says that
15/03/22, 8:49 am - mehul mathur: they need average of the evaluation metrics on each fold of the k-fold crossval
15/03/22, 8:50 am - Pooja: yeah ik
15/03/22, 8:50 am - Pooja: That's why i asked
15/03/22, 8:51 am - Pooja: He said average of any evaluation metric is ok
15/03/22, 8:51 am - Pooja: If we mention in report
15/03/22, 8:51 am - mehul mathur: did you download the data
15/03/22, 8:51 am - Pooja: Ok but even if we re allowed that idk what to do next
15/03/22, 8:51 am - Pooja: yeah
15/03/22, 8:51 am - mehul mathur: how much you coded until now
15/03/22, 9:56 am - Pooja: Can we go dinner

17/03/22, 9:35 am - mehul mathur: Ok wait so what was decided for evaluation metrics?
17/03/22, 9:35 am - mehul mathur: Do we have to split train validation and test?
17/03/22, 9:36 am - mehul mathur: And then we can show any metric in cross  valid but the metrics they gave on test right?
17/03/22, 9:39 am - +91 86059 36547 started a call

25/04/22, 5:08 am - Pooja: Damnnn niceee
25/04/22, 5:09 am - mehul mathur: and this is after i took smaller set because it was out of memory
25/04/22, 5:09 am - mehul mathur: but thats fine
25/04/22, 5:09 am - mehul mathur: ill do intern work now write that naren description after that

- Setup and ran initial code on ADA
- Trained and got few outputs (the bulldozer model and others)
    - **How nerf works**
        - Nerf is basically a overfitted function model which takes input 5 parameters-
            - X - X world coordinate
            - Y - Y World coordinate
            - Z - Z world coordinate
            - Theta and Phi - Camera position (or orienation angles from which the model is viewed)
            
        - It outputs the RGB color and the density - sigma (alpha value)
        - So using the weights of such a model a 3d object can be recreated from any angle
    - **Implementation**
        - Create a Deep cnn network which initially takes in the 3 coordinates x,y,z as input and outputs just the density and a 256 dimenstional vector
        - Using both of these concatenate with the orientation angles to also give the color values - RGB
        - Used pytorch
- Currently implementing code for ray sampling and collecting pictures of real objects in iiith
    - **Sampling along the ray**
        - Two train the model , given some sparse collection of images of the 3d object , a ray is passsed perpendicularly through each pixel of each image
        - Along this ray points are sampled - Each point is (x , y , z) and theta and phi (angle orientation of the ray)
        - The output at each point is obtained - RGB , alpha
        - Then these values are integrated along the ray to obtain one color of that pixel
        - Then this color is compared with the ground truth one (difference) and then this loss is backpropogated
- Converting these real life images to data to be inputted in the model

02/05/22, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: ok cog sci what are you doing
02/05/22, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: we need another dataset no
02/05/22, 6:15 am - mehul mathur: ill run shit on the current one you found you find another one?
02/05/22, 6:19 am - Pooja: arey what
02/05/22, 6:19 am - Pooja: No
02/05/22, 6:19 am - Pooja: I'm doing on the one i found

02/05/22, 6:19 am - Pooja: Why we need anotherone
02/05/22, 6:19 am - Manasvi💩: what are you doing tho?
02/05/22, 6:19 am - mehul mathur: we dont need?
02/05/22, 6:19 am - Pooja: Why?
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: Idk I'm figuring it out
02/05/22, 6:20 am - mehul mathur: then what else we had in cog si?
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: just loading rn and seeing what data is there in that
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: they had a bunch of baseline models in their code
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: Some gpt2 thing
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: in our interim report we said we did that
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: so we need to do those also
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: Yeah I'll run those models on this new dataset
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: Can you check this part
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: there were 4 I think
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Manasvi💩: we can split
02/05/22, 6:20 am - Pooja: we put all 4 in report?
02/05/22, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: what is gpt2 part
02/05/22, 6:21 am - Manasvi💩: we said we did 3 and have to do 4th
02/05/22, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: there is no gpt2
02/05/22, 6:21 am - Manasvi💩: thats the text generation part
02/05/22, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: ah ok wait
02/05/22, 6:21 am - mehul mathur: so same dataset we can use to train generation also no?
02/05/22, 6:22 am - Manasvi💩: ya
02/05/22, 6:22 am - mehul mathur: so ok ill do text generation with this
02/05/22, 6:22 am - Manasvi💩: but to train gpt2
02/05/22, 6:22 am - Manasvi💩: we need data generated from our model
